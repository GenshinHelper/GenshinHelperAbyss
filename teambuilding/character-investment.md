# Character Investment

**Much of this doc is slightly outdated as it does not account for recent DPS hikes in the abyss. It is in the process of being updated. Most of the strategy on character investment is the same though!**

A common reason that players will get stuck in the higher floors of Abyss is that they will suddenly be unable to output enough damage to clear a Chamber. Usually, the main reason for this is that they have spent their resources (primarily resin) inefficiently, either by investing in the wrong things, or trying to invest in too many characters at once.

This guide will walk you through where to focus your resources to have the best chance at clearing Abyss as early as possible. The faster you reach Floors 9 - 12, the more Primogems you will have access to every reset!

## General Tips

#### Focus on investing on 2 Main DPS and 2-4 Supports (including 2 healers)

Spreading out your resources is a common reason players aren't able to progress through Abyss. If your goal is to get through Abyss, it's best to prioritize just a few characters to start.&#x20;

#### Save your Fragile Resin until AR45

The highest level artifact domains **guarantee a 5**★\*\* artifact\*\* with every run, and these unlock at **AR45**. Artifacts are key to beating higher floors of Abyss, and having a large stock of **Fragile Resin** as soon as you're able to access the highest level domains is the best way to gear up quickly.

#### Prioritize weapon levels

You can craft **enhancement ores** at the blacksmith without using resin. This makes weapon levels very resource efficient for damage. When entering a new **World Level**, you should prioritize getting your weapon to the max level as soon as possible.

### Build Guides

If you're not sure what artifacts/weapons/builds are best for a character, check out the Genshin Helper Team's [Build Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0\_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml)!

## AR 1 - 29

You should expect to clear Floor 3 around **AR20-25**. Once you've gotten **Xiangling**, you can hold off on progressing through Abyss until higher ARs. Rewards in Floors 1- 8 don't reset, so there's no rush to do it.

### Artifacts

* Focus on equipping artifacts for their **set bonuses** and don't worry too much about artifact levels
* Look out for any **4**★ artifacts you find that have the correct **mainstat**. These can be worth levelling if you need more damage

## AR 30 - 44

Once you reach **AR35 or AR40** and unlock **Level 70 or 80** characters/weapons, you should attempt the higher floors of Abyss. Even with minimal artifact investment, it's possible to clear up to about **Floor 10** of Abyss at this point.

### Artifacts

* It may be tempting to start farming artifact domains at **AR40**, however these don't yet guarantee a 5★ artifact, so it is better to wait until **AR45**. Two exceptions here are the support sets **Noblesse Oblige** and **Viridescent Veneer**. These mostly used for their set bonuses, so will work fine even with 4★ pieces.
* Continue to focus on **set bonuses** over levelling artifacts.
* 5★ artifacts will start dropping from world bosses. Keep an eye out for any that drop with the correct mainstat for your main DPS. These will often be worth levelling.

## AR 45+

If you have been saving your **Fragile Resin**, this is where you start spending them on the artifact domain for your **main DPS**. Once both teams are well equipped damage wise, you should be able to clear **Floor 12**!

### Artifacts

* The exact artifact choices will be different for each character. Check out a [build guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0\_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml) to see what is best for your choses character.
* Aim for a **1 CRIT Rate : 2 CRIT DMG** ratio for your character. This will affect your **weapon** and **circlet** choices.
* In some cases, a good set of **substats** on artifacts may be better than trying to maintain a 4pc **set bonus**. This can also happen if you get unlucky and don't drop a **CRIT** circlet in your required set. If this happens, you may want to go for just a 2pc bonus and wear 3 off-set pieces.
* Artifact farming is quite RNG heavy, so don't try to chase perfect substats right from the start. Focus on finding just a correct mainstat piece first. You should almost always level the first one of these you find for your set.

#### Supports

Artifacts for supports are much harder to generalize. Supports that have high damage abilities may be worth investing in early on, whereas supports that mostly heal or buff may not need much investment at all.

Focus on your main DPS characters first, but once you have the correct mainstat pieces for those, don't neglect your supports! When striving to reach 36\*s, having strong supports can make all the difference in shaving off those last few seconds.

### Benchmarks

|              |    Char Lvl   |    Weap Lvl   | Talent Lvl |           Artifacts           |
| ------------ | :-----------: | :-----------: | :--------: | :---------------------------: |
| **Main DPS** | 70/80 - 80/80 |     80/80     |      8     |    +20 on 5★ with mainstat    |
| **Support**  |     60/70     | 70/70 - 80/80 |    4 - 6   | +8 or +12 on 5★ with mainstat |

## Building to 36★

A common theme of reaching 36\* as fast as possible is choosing specific areas of investment that will yield the highest rewards for the lowest cost. **Eventually you will want to upgrade everything,** including supports/healers/supporting artifacts and weapons on the supports, but the order that you do them in is critical to reaching faster progress.

Once you reach **AR50**, you will have access to another ascension level. You should pre-farm materials to be able to immediately ascend your main DPS **weapon** to **90/90** as soon as you reach **AR50**. This will give you a best damage boost for it's cost.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Avoid leveling characters to 90/90!** Character ascensions and levels are much worse for damage than weapons for their cost. If you want to reach 36★ as quickly as possible, don't spend your resources here. Note: this is not to say that you should never level those characters up, but if we're speaking on strict efficiency, then you should do this last.
{% endhint %}

Obtaining all 36★ in the Abyss is going to be a pure DPS check. To pass this you will need to start paying more attention to artifact **substats** to increase your damage further.

You will also want to start investing in characters other than just your **main DPS**. Many characters you would think of as "support" do significant damage when equipped with proper artifacts. This can often be better than trying to maximize substats for a single character.

### Overview

You want to focus on a couple of areas most when striving to 36\*:

1. Getting high Crit/Atk rolls on artifacts and leveling them to 20 for DPS and Supports.
2. Getting Weapons to 90 if not done already on both DPS and high DPS supports
3. Moving from pure healers to more nuanced and multi-dimensional characters if not done yet.
4. _Learning how to best play your DPS characters (proper sequences and styles). This is often the most important, especially in today's Abyss._

### Artifacts

* 5★ artifacts with the **correct mainstat** and **two CRIT substats** may be worth levelling even if they are an off-set. A well rolled piece can very easily be better than trying to maintain a set bonus.&#x20;
* Different characters will take well to different improvements in artifacts and substats (research your characters!!).

### Benchmarks

Keep in mind that certain talents and certain weapons will mean significantly more to level up than others. For example Mona Q or Bennett Q is often better to crown (get to talent level 10) than a DPS chars talent due to sheer versatility. **Know what characters you're working with and how to best optimize them with the resources you have.** Refer to the help-strat doc as needed for this.

### Playing More Skillfully

Probably the hardest, most nuanced part of striving towards 36\*s. In the past, good DPS and supports were enough to get you 36\*s but nowadays, unless you have extremely strong characters with refined weapons, you need more than just strength. For this its best to:

1. Do research into your main dps characters and learn their best sequences (especially the case for characters like Eula).
2. Practice iFrames and learning how to battery + other techniques.
3. Watch Gameplays of 36\* stars to see how you can use your chars to clear.

You could argue this is totally overkill, but there is indeed a massive community and following on how to optimize characters and clear abyss fastest. After all this is the area that you have the most control over in a Gacha game that is largely dictated by luck in chars/weapons/artifacts. Considering joining reputed character main servers as many already have resources for members on how to best play characters.

## FAQ

### What character should I build?

While some characters are stronger than others, you should invest in characters that you truly enjoy playing. Any character can be used to clear all the content in the game as long as they’re built right and have a strong supporting team. The main difference will be that some characters will take more resources to reach the same point as another, so find a balance between viability and enjoyability.

Check out [Building a Composition](building-a-composition.md#cores) for some suggestions on strong teams you can build around a character you enjoy.

### **Should I spend Primogems on Resin refreshes?**

Ultimately it's up to you how you want to spend your Primogems, but in general you should not refresh. While refreshing gets you better gear faster, if you spend your resources correctly you will have more than enough Resin naturally to make your way through Abyss in a month or two of playtime.

### Should I keep fighting weekly bosses if I don't need any of their talent material drops?

Yes! Weekly bosses give a lot of resources for their cost, particularly **Gladiator/Wanderer** set pieces. You should continue to do them. Who knows, you may one day roll the character that needs that material anyway.

### How important are character constellations for Abyss?

Not at all! You can 36★ Abyss with all C0 characters. Some constellations however do give a significant boost, but it does vary from character to character. If you are investing in a character, research which constellations are most important and try for them when they're featured if you need the boost. 5★ constellations are absolutely not necessary and you should only get those if you can afford them.

### I don't see Elemental Mastery mentioned anywhere. How important is it?

EM can be powerful for the right characters/compositions but difficult to generalize, so we haven't mentioned it. You will have to research builds for the characters you choose to invest in to see if EM will be beneficial for you or not.

### When should I stop investing in a character?

Fully optimizing a character takes a large amount of time/resources, and is not recommended. You should only do this once you have a team that can 36★ Abyss and only for fun.

As a general guideline for a DPS role, aim for above **1700 ATK**, and roughly **50% CRIT Rate / 100% CRIT DMG**. After that, you should start looking into investing in supports as well invested supports can output a significant amount of damage for a lot less than it would cost to improve your DPS stats further.
