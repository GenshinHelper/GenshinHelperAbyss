# Character Investment

A common reason that players will get stuck in the higher floors of Abyss is that they will suddenly be unable to output enough damage to clear a Chamber. Usually, the main reason for this is that they have spent their resources \(primarily resin\) inefficiently, either by investing in the wrong things, or trying to invest in too many characters at once.

This guide will walk you through where to focus your resources to have the best chance at clearing Abyss as early as possible. The faster you reach Floors 9 - 12, the more Primogems you will have access to every reset!

## General Tips

#### Focus on investing on 2 Main DPS and 2-4 Supports \(including 2 healers\)

Spreading out your resources is a common reason players aren't able to progress through Abyss. If your goal is to get through Abyss, it's best to prioritize just a few characters to start.

#### Save your Fragile Resin until AR45

The highest level artifact domains **guarantee a 5**★ **artifact** with every run, and these unlock at **AR45**. Artifacts are key to beating higher floors of Abyss, and having a large stock of **Fragile Resin** as soon as you're able to access the highest level domains is the best way to gear up quickly.

#### Prioritize weapon levels

You can craft **enhancement ores** at the blacksmith without using resin. This makes weapon levels very resource efficient for damage. When entering a new **World Level**, you should prioritize getting your weapon to the max level as soon as possible.

### Build Guides

If you're not sure what artifacts/weapons/builds are best for a character, check out the Genshin Helper Team's [Build Guide](%20https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml)!

## AR 1 - 29

You should expect to clear Floor 3 around **AR20-25**. Once you've gotten **Xiangling**, you can hold off on progressing through Abyss until higher ARs. Rewards in Floors 1- 8 don't reset, so there's no rush to do it.

### Artifacts

* Focus on equipping artifacts for their **set bonuses** and don't worry too much about artifact levels
* Look out for any **4**★ artifacts you find that have the correct **mainstat**. These can be worth levelling if you need more damage

## AR 30 - 44

Once you reach **AR35 or AR40** and unlock **Level 70 or 80** characters/weapons, you should attempt the higher floors of Abyss. Even with minimal artifact investment, it's possible to clear up to about **Floor 10** of Abyss at this point.

### Artifacts

* It may be tempting to start farming artifact domains at **AR40**, however these don't yet guarantee a 5★ artifact, so it is better to wait until **AR45**. Two exceptions here are the support sets **Noblesse Oblige** and **Viridescent Veneer**. These mostly used for their set bonuses, so will work fine even with 4★ pieces.
* Continue to focus on **set bonuses** over levelling artifacts.
* 5★ artifacts will start dropping from world bosses. Keep an eye out for any that drop with the correct mainstat for your main DPS. These will often be worth levelling.

## AR 45+

If you have been saving your **Fragile Resin**, this is where you start spending them on the artifact domain for your **main DPS**. Once both teams are well equipped damage wise, you should be able to clear **Floor 12**! 

### Artifacts

* The exact artifact choices will be different for each character. Check out a [build guide](%20https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml) to see what is best for your choses character.
* Aim for a **1 CRIT Rate : 2 CRIT DMG** ratio for your character. This will affect your **weapon** and **circlet** choices.
* In some cases, a good set of **substats** on artifacts may be better than trying to maintain a 4pc **set bonus**. This can also happen if you get unlucky and don't drop a **CRIT** circlet in your required set. If this happens, you may want to go for just a 2pc bonus and wear 3 off-set pieces.
* Artifact farming is quite RNG heavy, so don't try to chase perfect substats right from the start. Focus on finding just a correct mainstat piece first. You should almost always level the first one of these you find for your set.

#### Supports

Artifacts for supports are much harder to generalize. Supports that have high damage abilities may be worth investing in early on, whereas supports that mostly heal or buff may not need much investment at all.

Focus on your main DPS characters first, but once you have the correct mainstat pieces for those, don't neglect your supports!

### Benchmarks

|  | Char Lvl | Weap Lvl | Talent Lvl | Artifacts |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Main DPS** | 70/80 - 80/80 | 80/80 | 8 | +20 on 5★ with mainstat |
| **Support** | 60/70 | 70/70 - 80/80 | 4 - 6 | +8 or +12 on 5★ with mainstat |

## Building to 36★

Once you reach **AR50**, you will have access to another ascension level. You should pre-farm materials to be able to immediately ascend your main DPS **weapon** to **90/90** as soon as you reach **AR50**. This will give you a best damage boost for it's cost.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Avoid levelling characters to 90/90!** Character ascensions and levels are much worse for damage than weapons for their cost. If you want to reach 36★ as quickly as possible, don't spend your resources here.
{% endhint %}

Obtaining all 36★ in the Abyss is going to be a pure DPS check. To pass this you will need to start paying more attention to artifact **substats** to increase your damage further.

You will also want to start investing in characters other than just your **main DPS**. Many characters you would think of as "support" do significant damage when equipped with proper artifacts. This can often be better than trying to maximize substats for a single character.

### Artifacts

* 5★ artifacts with the **correct mainstat** and **two CRIT substats** may be worth levelling even if they are an off-set. A well rolled piece can very easily be better than trying to maintain a set bonus.

### Benchmarks

| **DPS** | 70/80 - 80/90 | 90/90 | 8 - 9 | +20 on 5★ with mainstat  and good substats |
| **Support** | 60/70 - 70/80 | 80/80 - 90/90 | 6 - 8 | +16 or +20 on 5★ with mainstat |

## FAQ

### What character should I build?

While some characters are stronger than others, you should invest in characters that you truly enjoy playing. Any character can be used to clear all the content in the game as long as they’re built right and have a strong supporting team. The main difference will be that some characters will take more resources to reach the same point as another, so find a balance between viability and enjoyability.

Check out [Building a Composition](building-a-composition.md#cores) for some suggestions on strong teams you can build around a character you enjoy.

### **Should I spend Primogems on Resin refreshes?**

Ultimately it's up to you how you want to spend your Primogems, but in general you should not refresh. While refreshing gets you better gear faster, if you spend your resources correctly you will have more than enough Resin naturally to make your way through Abyss in a month or two of playtime.

### Should I keep fighting weekly bosses if I don't need any of their talent material drops?

Yes! Weekly bosses give a lot of resources for their cost, particularly **Gladiator/Wanderer** set pieces. You should continue to do them. Who knows, you may one day roll the character that needs that material anyway.

### How important are character constellations for Abyss?

Not at all! You can 36★ Abyss with all C0 characters. Some constellations however do give a significant boost, but it does vary from character to character. If you are investing in a character, research which constellations are most important and try for them when they're featured if you need the boost. 5★ constellations are absolutely not necessary and you should only get those if you can afford them.

### I don't see Elemental Mastery mentioned anywhere. How important is it?

EM can be powerful for the right characters/compositions but difficult to generalize, so we haven't mentioned it. You will have to research builds for the characters you choose to invest in to see if EM will be beneficial for you or not.

### When should I stop investing in a character?

Fully optimizing a character takes a large amount of time/resources, and is not recommended. You should only do this once you have a team that can 36★ Abyss and only for fun.

As a general guideline for a DPS role, aim for above **1700 ATK**, and roughly **40% CRIT Rate / 80% CRIT DMG**. After that, you should start looking into investing in supports as well invested supports can output a significant amount of damage for a lot less than it would cost to improve your DPS stats further.
