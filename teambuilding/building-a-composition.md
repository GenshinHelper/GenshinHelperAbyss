# Building a Composition

There's many different ways to approach teambuilding, however for Abyss it's not recommended to try to build a "perfect" 4 character team and use it for every single floor. Each floor has different divergences and monsters, so it's best to modify your teams to suit the floor.

## Teambuilding Approach

### Pick a core

Your core is responsible for dealing most of the damage for your team, and usually consists of a pair of characters with good synergy. These are the characters which you should prioritize investing in for weapons/artifacts/talents. 

For Abyss, you will need at least 1 core for each team. When starting a floor, look at the mobs and tips for the floor to decide which side each core should go on.

{% hint style="info" %}
If possible, try to use different types of damage between the two teams in order to avoid being heavily disadvantaged if a floor is bad for a specific element.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The cores listed here are intentionally limited to only suggesting **2 character combinations**. This leaves the most room for flexibility for each abyss floor. This means there will be some compositions that require specific 3 or 4 characters that will not be included here.
{% endhint %}

### Add supports

Which supports you choose for each team will vary depending on the specific requirements for the floor.

{% hint style="info" %}
The best supports will often fill in more than one of these categories. This is why pure healers like Barbara or Qiqi are not usually recommended over other more versatile supports like Bennett or Zhong Li.
{% endhint %}

#### Healer

Each team should have a character than can heal. 

{% hint style="info" %}
While it's possible to run a strong shield character like Zhong Li instead of a healer, it's not recommended
{% endhint %}

#### Shieldbreakers

Prioritize adding any elements you are missing for breaking enemy shields. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you're not sure what elements you need, check out the guides on each floor! Each one will list the shieldbreaking requirements at the very top
{% endhint %}

#### Resonance

Adding![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)resonance is an easy way to add damage to any team if the floor allows it. This gives a nice boost early on but drops off on the later floors as you get better stats.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)/![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) resonances are very good for specific compositions that rely on **Freeze** / ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)**DMG**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) resonance is good on teams that will swap between **Elemental Skills** often.

![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)/![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)resonances are the weakest and usually not worth going for specifically.

#### Energy

Commonly referred to as a **battery**, these supports are the same element as a core character and are good at generating energy to keep their **Bursts** up more often, helping you deal more damage.

#### Crowd Control

Characters that are able to disable enemies in various ways. This will often be a character than can enable **Freeze** to disable enemies, or an ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) character whose abilities will pick up and knock down enemies.

#### Damage

These supports boost the damage of your core unit in some way, either by:

* Buffing your team \(**Bennet**, ****character using **Noblesse Oblige** set\)
* Debuffing your enemies \(**Zhong Li**, ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)using **Viridescent Veneer** set\)
* Adding resonance

## Cores

### Razor/Keqing + Cryo

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |

* Make sure to regularly trigger **Superconduct** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) + ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) to reduce enemy ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **RES** for damage. The debuff lasts **12 seconds**.
* **Diona** and **Qiqi** are the preferred supports as they also fill in for you as a **healer**.

### Eula/Rosaria/Kaeya + Electro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)

* Make sure to regularly trigger **Superconduct** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) + ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) to reduce enemy ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **RES** for damage. The debuff lasts **8 seconds**.
* Adding a ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)support is a nice way to add **Freeze** on this team for extra **Crowd Control**.
* When using **Eula**, it is highly recommended to bring a **Battery** in another slot \(e.g. **Diona**\) due to her damage being very **Burst** dependent.

### Bennet + Chongyun

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)

| DPS | Support |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_bennett.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png)  |

* This core is centered around the **Melt** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Use **Chongyun's Elemental Skill** to have **Bennett's** attacks apply ****![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) to an enemy before hitting it with **Bennett's Elemental Skill/Burst.**
* Even without a dedicated support build, **Bennett's Elemental Burst** should be enough healing to cover this team. You should not need a second healer.

### Pyro DPS + Hydro

* This core is centered around the **Vaporize** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)\) reaction. Utilizes **Xiangling's Elemental Skill/Burst** hitting enemies affected by ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media).

* You will often want to run another ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)character in a flex slot to have ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**resonance**.

### Fischl/Beidou + Hydro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) 

| DPS | Best Support/DPS | Other Supports |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

* This core is centered around the **Electrocharged** \(![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) reaction. Use a combination of talents that apply both elements to enemies for damage.
* Your![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) characters will give most of the damage while **off-field** and another character is attacking and applying ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media).

### Keqing + Hydro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media)

* This core is centered around the **Electrocharged** \(![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\) reaction. Utilizes **Keqing's** ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) **infusion** and strong **Charged Attack.**

### Ganyu + Xiangling

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)

| DPS | Support |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_ganyu.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_xiangling.png)  |

* This core is centered around the **Reverse Melt** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Use **Xiangling's Elemental Skill/Burst** to apply ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)to an enemy and then hit them with a **Full Charge Attack** from **Ganyu**.

### Ganyu/Ayaka + Hydro

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |

* This core is centered around the **Freeze** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) reaction. Apply  ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)to enemies and then use a combination of **Ganyu's Charged Attacks** and **Elemental Burst** or **Ayaka's Attacks** to deal damage to **frozen** enemies.
* You will often want to run another ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)character in a flex slot to have ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**resonance**. **Diona** in particular is an excellent choice as she also provides shields/heals and plenty of energy.
* **Xingqiu** can work for Ayaka but is not as ideal with Ganyu as it is hard to weave normal attacks into a charge attack sequence. In the same way, Mona is not as effective for hydro application if you are doing a lot of normal attacks with Ayaka.

### Kaeya/Rosaria + Chongyun

**Primary Damage Type -**  ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)

| DPS | Support |
| :---: | :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_kaeya.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_rosaria.png)  | ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_chongyun.png)  |

* While this core does not inherently have a reaction, you should add additional supports such as![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fsync%2F1a9d730812988c6cd8678f117630d179f689cee0.png?generation=1615182626544397&alt=media)for **Freeze** and/or ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)for **Melt** reactions.
* While **Chongyun** could be the DPS, he is generally not recommended because his claymore attacks will **shatter** frozen targets, which ultimately will lower your DPS.

### Ningguang + Geo

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) 

| DPS | Best Supports | Other Supports |

* Usually you would want at least **C1** on **Ningguang** before using this comp to help with AoE damage.
* Craftable catalyst options are not great so you may also want to avoid this core if you don't have a good weapon. Check the [Build Guide](%20https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRq-sQxkvdbvaJtQAGG6iVz2q2UN9FCKZ8Mkyis87QHFptcOU3ViLh0_PJyMxFSgwJZrd10kbYpQFl1/pubhtml) to see if you have access to one of her preferred weapons.
* With two ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) chars, shield breaking can be an issue on some floors. In particular, this core can't cover all required elements on **Floor 7.**

### Xiao + Anemo

* This core is focused around **Xiao's Elemental Burst** and **Plunge Attacks**. Use your ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)support to generate energy for **Xiao** when his **Burst** is on cooldown.
* **Venti** is no ideal for this as enemies caught in his **Elemental Burst** cannot be hit by **Xiao**.

### Venti + Jean

**Primary Damage Type -** ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)

| DPS |
| :---: |
| ![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_jean.png)![](../.gitbook/assets/ui_avataricon_venti.png) |

* This core works by combining the high damage scaling of both **Jean** and **Venti's Elemental Skills/Bursts**, the **cooldown reduction** from ![](../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)**resonance**, and general high **energy generation** to continually output damage with their talents.
