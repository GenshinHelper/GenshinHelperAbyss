Spawns directly in front of you in a "V" shape. If you stay where you are, you will not be hit by it.

![Electro Triangle rapidly damage you if touched](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_aura_damage.gif)

Touching any part of the triangle causes you to take damage quickly, at a rate of **8 ticks/seconds**. \
\
The damage will also cause your character's attacks to be interrupted. Prioritize moving out of it. 

![Dashing through Electro Triangle](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_aura_iframe.gif)

You can **dash** through it to avoid all damage. Make sure you dash straight through it and not at an angle, or you may end your dash still touching it and take damage.
