Before the explosion, a ring will appear that shows the AoE of the blast. Running out of the circle is the most effective way to not get hit.

Alternatively, you can try to time a dodge for when the blast happens. The delay is about 5 seconds from when you see the ring appear, but it is difficult to time right.

The type of damage depends on the enemy, and seems to be related to the **shield**. The blast will apply the corresponding element to you.
