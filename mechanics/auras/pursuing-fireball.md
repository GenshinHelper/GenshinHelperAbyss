Spawns from an enemy and travels towards the player. When it reaches you, it will stop and do **3 explosions**. It will then follow you again **1-2** more times, triggering another **3 explosions** each time.

It is very difficult to completely avoid the fireball. Dashing too early will cause the fireball to turn quickly and still hit you. If you get hit, quickly move out of the AoE to avoid the next 2 explosions.

It is possible to avoid all damage with the correct dodge timing.

![Fireball only doing 2 sets of explosions](../../.gitbook/assets/goodbye_fire_aura\_2.gif)

The fireball is duration based, lasting about **10 seconds** max. Causing the fireball to travel further will actually reduce the number of total explosions.

Moving far enough away from the fireball between explosions can also cause it to fly off the arena.
