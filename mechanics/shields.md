# Shields

## Mechanics

You will encounter many enemies in Abyss that have some form of shield ability. Knowing how to properly deal with the shields is important in clearing certain floors.

### Elemental Effectiveness

Elements have different levels of effectiveness against certain shields. Knowing these interactions is important when choosing which characters to bring for a particular floor/chamber where shields are present.

### Elemental Gauge

Shields often do not have HP like regular monsters. They instead have a specific amount of **Elemental Gauge Units** that can be depleted by triggering **Reactions**. Once these units are depleted, then the shield will be broken. How quickly you take down a shield depends on several factors:

* How **effective** the element is against the shield. Refer to the section above on **Elemental Effectiveness**.
* How strong the ability used against the shield is at applying the element.
* The **cooldown** of the skill used to apply the element and/or the **frequency** that it applies the element.

#### Does character damage affect shieldbreaking?

For **Elemental Armor** and **Physical Shields**, damage does not factor into shieldbreaking at all. On **Elemental Shields**, damage is factored in, however the amount of damage you need to close to **Reaction** damage is extremely high, so in practice, you can also treat it as being unimportant.

This means that a completely un-invested character will be as effective as a fully invested character when it comes to shieldbreaking ability. As long as you can keep them alive, don't be afraid to bring your un-invested characters along to help with shields in specific chambers.

For more in depth information on **Elemental Gauges**, please see the **Resources** section at the bottom of this page. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Infused** attacks that apply an element have a special cooldown referred to as **Internal Cooldown \(ICD\)**. This means that faster **Normal Attacks** do not necessarily mean you will apply the element any faster.

You can get around this restriction by swapping characters between attacks \(which resets ICD\), or using **Charged/Plunging Attacks**, which do not have an ICD.=
{% endhint %}



### Geo Shields

Unlike other shields, ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) can also be broken without using elemental reactions. You can use:

* **Crystallize** reactions
* ![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)damage
* **Claymore** attacks
* **Overload** \(![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\)
* Other **explosive** attacks \(**Klee**\)

## Shield Types

Different types of shields will block damage in different ways.

### Elemental Shields

These shields **block all damage** until the shield is destroyed.

#### Tips

* These type of shields often have very high **Elemental Gauge**. Repeatable sources of elemental application work best.
* Make sure to save your high damage abilities until after the shield goes down.

#### Enemies that use Elemental Shields

|  | Enemy | Shield HP \(U\) |

|  | Cryo Slime | 8 |
|  | Geo Slime |  |

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that **Abyss Lector** shields do not obey the **Elemental Effectiveness** table. ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) and ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) are both equally effective.
{% endhint %}

### Elemental Armor

These shields **reduce damage** until the shield is destroyed.

#### Tips

* The mechanics of these shields vary greatly depending on the enemy. Make sure to check the help page for the enemy for how the shield works.
* Make sure to save your high damage abilities until after the shield goes down.

#### Enemies that use Elemental Armor

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that **Fatui** shields do not obey the **Elemental Effectiveness** table. They will only take damage from elements that are **most effective** against their shield. All other elements have greatly reduced effectiveness.  
  
The **Hydrogunner** is a special case since there is not an effective element against ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) shields. Their shields are weak to![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png).
{% endhint %}

### Physical Shields

These shields **block all damage** from the direction the shield is facing.

#### Tips

* Enemies will be vulnerable when performing their attacks. You can use these windows to get damage in.
* **Taunt** abilities can draw aggro and make the enemies face away from you. Attacks from behind will not be blocked.
* Enemies that are **Frozen** will not be able to block damage from any direction. You can use this to bypass shield damage entirely.
* Some **Charged Attacks** and **Plunging Attacks** can bypass enemy shields.
* Enemies will still take damage from **Elemental Reactions**
