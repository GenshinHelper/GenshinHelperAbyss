# Debuffs

## Mechanics

Debuffs apply an **element** to the character, as well as a secondary effect based on the element.

|                    Element                   | Name                  | Effect                                                                                    |
| :------------------------------------------: | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)  | **Smoldering Flames** | Active character takes![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) **DMG** once every second |
|   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)  | **Condensed Ice**     | Increases **Stamina Consumption** by **2x**                                               |
|  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)  | **Slowing Water**     | Increases **Skill Cooldowns** by **2x**                                                   |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) | **Engulfing Storm**   | Drains **5 energy** every 3 seconds                                                       |

All debuffs last **20 seconds\***, or until the **element** is removed by an** elemental reaction**, often called **cleansing**. (See [Removing Debuffs](removing-debuffs.md) for detailed information).

There is one exception. **Slowing Waters** on **Floor 11** in **v1.5** appears to last a full **30 seconds**

Debuffs can either come from an **Aura **(enemy), or be part of the **Stage** (divergence in Domain/Abyss). The two have slightly different mechanics.

|              | Aura             | Stage        |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ |
| **Duration** | 20s              | 20s\*        |
| **Timer**    | 15s              | 30s          |
| **Range**    | Limited          | Unlimited    |
| **Affects**  | Active Character | Entire Party |

### Aura Debuff

Enemies that inflict debuffs will have a set of **glowing rings** as their **aura** underneath. When you are hit by the aura, an icon of the element will show briefly above the character, and you will have a **red icon** of the element above your HP bar along with the regular element icon.

Aura debuffs **only affect the active character**. Inactive party members will not be affected. Switching to another character will **move the debuff onto that character**.

The **outer ring** shows the range of the debuff when it activates. You can avoid the debuff by being outside of the circle when it pulses. You **cannot** avoid this using i-frames from a dodge or burst.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain abilities are not able to **cleanse** aura debuffs of certain elements! See [Aura Debuffs](https://genshinhelper.gitbook.io/abyss/mechanics/debuffs/removing-debuffs#aura-debuff) for more details.
{% endhint %}

### Stage Debuff

Some stages will periodically apply a **debuff** to an entire team. This cannot be avoided.

There is no additional indicator when you are affected by a stage debuff. Only the element icon is shown.
