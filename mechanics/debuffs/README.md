# Debuffs

## Mechanics

Debuffs apply an **element** to the character, as well as a secondary effect based on the element.

| Element | Name | Effect |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) | **Smoldering Flames** | Active character takes![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) **DMG** once every second |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) | **Condensed Ice** | Increases **Stamina Consumption** by **2x** |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) | **Slowing Water** | Increases **Skill Cooldowns** by **2x** |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) | **Engulfing Storm** | Drains **5 energy** every 3 seconds |

All debuffs last **20 seconds**, or until **cleansed** by an elemental reaction \(see [Removing Debuffs](removing-debuffs.md)\).

Debuffs can either come from an **Aura** \(enemy\), or be part of the **Stage** \(divergence in Domain/Abyss\). The two have slightly different mechanics.

|  | Aura | Stage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Duration** | 20s | 20s |
| **Timer** | 15s | 30s |
| **Range** | Limited | Unlimited |
| **Affects** | Active Character | Entire Party |

### Aura Debuff

Enemies that inflict debuffs will have a set of **glowing rings** as their **aura** underneath. When you are hit by the aura, an icon of the element will show briefly above the character, and you will have a **red icon** of the element above your HP bar along with the regular element icon.

Aura debuffs **only affect the active character**. Inactive party members will not be affected. Switching to another character will **move the debuff onto that character**.

The **outer ring** shows the range of the debuff when it activates. You can avoid the debuff by being outside of the circle when it pulses. You **cannot** avoid this using i-frames from a dodge or burst.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain abilities are not able to **cleanse** aura debuffs of certain elements! See [Removing Debuffs](removing-debuffs.md) for more details.

### Stage Debuff

Some stages will periodically apply a **debuff** to an entire team. This cannot be avoided.
