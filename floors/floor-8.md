# Floor 8

## Divergence

* When **HP** is less than **50%**, **ATK** and **DEF** are increased by **50%**
* When **HP** is less than **45%**, **Normal Attack SPD** is increased by **30%**
* When **HP** is less than **45%**, **Movement SPD** is increased by **20%**
* When **HP** is less than **30%**, **CRIT Rate** is increased by **20%** and **CRIT DMG** is increased by **40%**

## General Tips

Keeping your **Main Carry** **below 30% HP** is important to maximize damage on this floor. If possible, prefer characters with **shields** over characters that **heal**. This allows you to mitigate damage while still keeping the floor buff active.

Avoid relying on strong healers such as **Barbara, Bennet, Jean, Qiqi**

**Chamber 2** also contains a **Ruin Guard** on each side. If you rely on ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **DMG**, you must bring **Superconduct** \( ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) + ![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) \).

**Chamber 2** also is much harder than the rest. If it is your first time clearing this floor, aim for **6**★ with a distribution of **3★/0★/3★**. This is often easier than trying to get stars on **Chamber 2**.

Bring a **Bow** character on each side with the correct element to disable the **Regisvine**. This also lets you disable the **Ruin Guards.**

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 70**

### Side 1

![](../.gitbook/assets/8-1-1.png)

**Cryo Abyss Mage** shield is much easier to break than the **Hydro Abyss Mage**. Focusing the **Cryo** first will prevent you from having to deal with being **Frozen**. 

You can sometimes push the two Abyss Mages together with movement or abilities, allowing you to hit both shields at once.

### Side 2

![](../.gitbook/assets/8-1-2.png)

Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) to bring down the **Pyro Abyss Mage** shield.

Focus the one with the **Fireball Aura** to stop it from spawning.

## **Chamber 2**

**Monster Level - 70**

### Side 1

![](../.gitbook/assets/8-2-1.png)

A pillar will periodically shield enemies with ![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png), reducing their damage taken. Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) to break the shield.

Focusing down the **Ruin Guard** first will save the most time.

## **Chamber 3**

**Monster Level - 70**

### Side 1

![](../.gitbook/assets/8-3-1.png)

Use ![](../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) to break the shield and stun the **Regisvine**.

The best way to star this chamber is to enter with low health to trigger the **divergence** buff, and kill it after staggering it the first time.
