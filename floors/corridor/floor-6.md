# Floor 6

## Divergence

* Using an **Elemental Burst** increases all party members' **ATK** and **DEF** by **6%**. Max 10 stacks. At **5 stacks** and above, increases character **Normal Attack SPD** and **Movement SPD** by an additional **30%**

## General Tips

Characters with **low cooldown/energy bursts** excel on this floor as supports. 

Outfitting these chars with **4pc Exile** is a great way to provide energy to let you spam their bursts and reach 5 stacks as quickly as possible.

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/6-1-1.png)

Prioritize attacking **Whopperflowers** when they have their shield up to prevent their attacks. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) is the most effective against their shields, but other elements and claymores will damage it as well.
