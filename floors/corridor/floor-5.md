# Floor 5

## Divergence

* When **HP** is greater than **50%**, **ATK** and **DEF** are increased by **25%**
* When **HP** is greater than **80**%, **Normal Attack SPD** is increased by **20%**
* When **HP** is greater than **80%**, **Movement SPD** is increased by **20%** 
* When **HP** is greater than **95%**, **CRIT Rate** is increased by **10%** and **CRIT DMG** is increased by **20%**

## General Tips

Keeping your **Main Carry** above **95% HP** is important to maximize damage on this floor. Make sure you bring characters with good healing/shielding on each team, and make an effort to avoid enemy attacks. If you are taking a lot of damage, consider bringing two supports per team if you have them.

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 55**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-1-1.png)

| Aura | DMG |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Ice Cage**](../../mechanics/auras/ice-cage.md)\*\*\*\* | 1594![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) |

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) is the most effective against **Cryo Slime** shields. Kill the **Cryo Slimes** before they can reshield 

Focus the **Large Cryo Slimes** as they are the most threatening followed by the **Archers** as they can disrupt your combos. The last **Large Cryo Slime** causes the **Ice Cage**. Prioritize it when it spawns

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-1-2.png)

| Aura | DMG |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Smoldering Flame** | 203![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)/ Tick \(?? DPS\) |

Focus the **Pyro Abyss Mage** on the left that has the **Aura** to prevent getting debuffed by **Smoldering Flames.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) ****is the most effective against **Pyro Abyss Mage** shields. Kill the Abyss Mages before they can reshield.

Staggering the Abyss Mage when their shields are down can prevent their attacks.

## **Chamber 2**

**Monster Level - 55**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-2-1.png)

Enemies will periodically be buffed with a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) shield, which reduces incoming damage. Use ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png) to remove it.

Fight near ranged enemies when possible and let the melee enemies come to you.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-2-2.png)

Enemies will periodically be buffed with a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)shield. Use ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)to remove it.

Fight near ranged enemies when possible and let the melee enemies come to you.

## **Chamber 3**

**Monster Level - 55**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-3-1.png)

Avoid using ranged autoattacks \(**Bow, Catalyst**\) as **Cicin** **Flies** can easily draw autoaim

Focus the **Cicin Mage** and let the melee **Hoarders** come to you.

The Cicin's **Aura** will drain your energy, so use bursts when they are up.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/5-3-2.png)

| Aura | DMG |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Fireball**](../../mechanics/auras/fireball.md)\*\*\*\* | 598![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)/ Explosion |

Focus down the **Electro Potioneers** first to prevent being **Overloaded**. The **Pyro Agent** will come to you.

The **Fireball** Aura from the **Pyro Agent** is difficult to avoid. Make sure you bring healing.
