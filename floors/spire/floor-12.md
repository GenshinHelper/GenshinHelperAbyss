## General Tips

* The chamber starts with 6 Thundercraven Rifthound Whelp, and spawns another as soon as you kill one. The last 2 of the 20 enemies are Thundercraven Rifthounds. (18 whelps  -> 2 rifthounds)
* Electro is a great choice against the Rifthounds as they’ll have less electro resistance after accumulating enough fury.
* However, as they’re easily knock-backed, freeze teams with an Anemo CC are still one of the best options to clear the chamber.
* Be wary of bleeding, as it’ll affect off-field characters which may kill them as soon as you swap characters.
