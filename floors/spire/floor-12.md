## General Tips

**Freeze** teams are one of the best options for Side 2 if you want to clear them all with one team.

Remember you can always build a dedicated team for each Chamber and retry the floor when going for stars, though the requirements for each Chamber here are quite similar.

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 95**

The chamber contains a pillar which applies a![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)shield to nearby enemies periodically, greatly reducing the damage they take. You must bring a consistent source of![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)to break it regularly. Catalyst users work best for this.

The stage contains many small enemies that spawn far apart, so make sure to bring an![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)character to group enemies together.

In the first wave, go for the **potioneers** first, as the other enemies will come to you. This also prevents you from being hit by **Freeze** from their attacks.

In the second wave, there will only be **3 potioneers** to start, but a new one will spawn until you've killed a total of 9 of them. Aim for these first as their elemental reactions will make it hard to deal with the **Kairagi**.

Remember to try and kill both **Kairagi** at the same time, to prevent one from healing and being resistance to CC.

**Freeze** teams are also effective here, as you have![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)for shields, lock down the enemies so they don't separate with attacks, and give you more time to kill the **Kairagi** before one heals.

### Side 2

| ****[ruin-guard.md](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-guard.md "mention")**** | 487K HP    |

The chamber contains a pillar which applies a![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)shield to nearby enemies periodically, greatly reducing the damage they take. You must bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)or![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png) to break it.

Since there are less enemies on this side, it's much easier to keep the shield off enemies.

The quickest way to group the Ruin Guards is to stand in the middle at the start and wait for both to walk towards you.

You can also run towards one Ruin Guard, but this will trigger a Missile attack from the other, making it take longer to group them.

In general, this side should be much easier than Side 1, so you should s your best charactesr there.

## Chamber 2

### Side 1

| In Depth Guide                                                                  | Other Info |

| [pyro-whopperflower.md](../../monsters/animals/pyro-whopperflower.md "mention") | 230K HP    |

The Whopperflowers spawn far away, but they will often drill close to you, so there's no need to chase them down.

It is highly recommended you bring an![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)character that can CC enemies. Whopperflowers are very vulnerable to these skills, and it will easily group them and also stop them from using their attacks.

Whopperflowers have high base resists which can only be lowered by breaking their shield attacks. Keeping them grouped is essential to clearing this in a timely manner.

Bringing![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)will allow you to break all of their shields. You can also use an![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)skill to **infuse** an element from one shield and use it to break other shields. This makes **Freeze** compositions an excellent choice on this side, as they normally include all of those things.

At the start, make sure to group together the two **Lectors**. You can do this by running to the far left or right of the arena, forcing one Lector to move towards the other.

Be aware that the Electro Lector's attacks can drain Energy, while the Abyss Herald attacks can affect skill cooldowns. This might mess up any rotations that you're used to.

Group the two Lectors by going directly to the side of one of them. The far one should start moving towards you and go next to the other.

If you're not good at dodging attacks, make sure to bring a good Healer here, as the Abyss Lector attacks can drain your HP through shields.

It is essential you bring a![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)character, preferably two. Abyss Heralds move around a lot with their attacks, and it is difficult to keep them grouped without being Frozen.

Try staying close to the wall. This will make it less likely for them to move far away during their attacks, and keep them grouped up more often. It will often waste more time trying to chase after them than simply waiting for them to come to you against the edge of the arena.
