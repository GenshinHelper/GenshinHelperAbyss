## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 96**

Geovishaps will infuse **35s** into the chamber.

Once infused, **Geovishaps** will gain resistance to that element \(30%\).

**Taunt** abilities are particularly effective here to give some time for you to recover stamina.

Attempting to dodge every attack will quickly drain your stamina. Focus on dodging both hits of the **Double Slam** attack, as this does the most damage. Rely on your shields/healing for other damage if you can.

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-1-1%20%283%29.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) **Geovishap** is immune to freeze

#### 3★ Tips

Avoid ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png)  **DMG**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)is particularly good here as you can **Overload/Melt** consistently on both **Geovishaps**.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-1-2%20%283%29.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) **Geovishap** is immune to freeze

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) **Geovishap** can easily be frozen by ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) after infusion.

#### 3★ Tips

Avoid ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png)  **DMG**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)is particularly good here as you can **Vaporize/Melt** consistently on both **Geovishaps**.

## Chamber 2

**Monster Level - 98**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-2-1%20%283%29.png)

| Monster | HP |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Cryo Cicin Mage**](../../monsters/fatui/cryo-cicin-mage.md)\*\*\*\* | ?? |

Enemies will periodically be buffed by an![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**shield** which reduces incoming damage. The most effective way to remove it is with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png), but ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)will also work.

#### 3★ Tips

The enemies here are particularly easy to group, so make sure to bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)on this side.

Once the first wave is about to ide, quickly run towards the **Cryo Cicin Mage**. If you can keep her staggered before she summons the Cicins, she will not be able to shield, which saves a lot of time.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-2-2%20%282%29.png)

Bring **shields** and/or **taunts** on this side if able.

**Geovishap Hatchlings** move around a lot and are hard to hit, which can cause large time losses. You can try using **Freeze** \(![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)+![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)\) to keep them locked down for longer if you are having trouble.

#### 3★ Tips

If you don't have access to a strong **Freeze** team, it's best to try to build a team that has high burst potential \(e.g. **Hu Tao**\) in order to deal significant damage before they can burrow.

## Chamber 3

**Monster Level - 100**

### Side 1

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-3-1%20%282%29.png)

| Monster | HP |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Abyss Lector**](../../monsters/abyss-order/abyss-lector.md)\*\*\*\* | ~735K HP |

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)works well for breaking shields on this side, as it is effective against both the **Abyss Lector** and the **Abyss Mage**.

If you have an ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)unit on this side, you can choose not to bring ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)for breaking the **Pyro Abyss Mage** shields. Instead, you can use your ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)skill on the **Hydro Abyss Mage** in order to **infuse** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png), and **Swirl** onto the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)shield to break it.

You can also use ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)to **Swirl** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)from the **Pyro Abyss Mage** shield onto the **Abyss Lector** during its shield phase for additional damage. If you choose to do this, make sure to eliminate the **Hydro Abyss Mage** first and leave the **Pyro Abyss Mage** alive, before focusing the **Abyss Lector**.

#### 3★ Tips

Trying to use the above strategies to swirl **Abyss Mage** shields is usually not recommended when going for stars, as it can be hard to pull off. The best bet is to attempt to group all the enemies together, and focus your AoE on the **Abyss Lector**. The **Abyss Mages** should go down during this time.

If you run towards the **Pyro Abyss Mage** at the start, you can often get the **Hydro Abyss Mage** to teleport next to it, grouping them. The **Abyss Lector** will move slightly, but you may need to stagger it into the **Abyss Mages** to fully group them.

### Side 2

![](../../.gitbook/assets/12-3-2%20%282%29.png)

| Monster | HP |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\*[**Abyss Herald**](../../monsters/abyss-order/abyss-herald.md)\*\*\*\* | ?? |

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)works best against **Abyss Herald** shields as it locks them in place with **Freeze**.

If you have an ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)unit on this side, you can choose not to bring ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)for breaking the **Cryo Abyss Mage** shields. Instead, you can use your ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)skill on the **Pyro Abyss Mage** in order to **infuse**![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png), and **Swirl** onto the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)shield to break it.

You can also use ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)to **Swirl** ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)from the **Cryo Abyss Mage** shield onto the **Abyss Herald** during its shield phase for additional damage. If you choose to do this, make sure to eliminate the **Pyro Abyss Mage** first and leave the **Cryo Abyss Mage** alive, before focusing the **Abyss Herald**.

#### 3★ Tips

Trying to use the above strategies to swirl **Abyss Mage** shields is usually not recommended when going for stars, as it can be hard to pull off. The best bet is to attempt to group all the enemies together, and focus your AoE on the **Abyss Herald**. The **Abyss Mages** should go down during this time.

You can use a similar strategy to group on this side as 12-3-1, but a more reliable strategy here is to run backwards at the start, away from the enemies. The **Abyss Mages** will both teleport to your location and group, and the **Abyss Herald** will run over not long after.
