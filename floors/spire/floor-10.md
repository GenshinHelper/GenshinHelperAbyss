## Divergence

There will be a **Leader** amongst the opponents present in each challenge on this floor. Its **Attendants** will also be present to provide it with enhancements and protection. 

Each **Attendant** will increase the **Leader's All RES** by **10%**. The **Attendants** will **restore the Leader's HP** every **12s**, with each **Attendant** restoring **5% HP**. 

When there are no Attendants, the Leader will not have any of the above enhancement and restoration effects.
