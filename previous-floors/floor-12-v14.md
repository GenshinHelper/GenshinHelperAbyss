# Floor 12 \(v1.3 - 1.4\)

## Divergence

* No Divergence

## General Tips

{% hint style="info" %}
The time requirements to 3★ Chambers 1 & 2 on Floor 12 were changed in v1.3!

Both Chamber 1 & 2 must now be done in **420 seconds** in order to 3★.
{% endhint %}

Avoid **Physical** based damage on this floor \(e.g. **Razor**\) and instead rely on **Elemental** damage. Both **Ruin Guards** and **Geovishaps** have high ![](../.gitbook/assets/physical_small.png) **RES**. If you need to use physical, make sure you bring **Superconduct** \(![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)+![](../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)\).

You may want a **Bow** user on each team in order to stun the **Ruin Gard/Ruin Grader** in Chamber 3.

While **Geovishaps** are resistant to ****![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png), bringing a **Geo Support** is a great way to survive against them by triggering **Crystallize** on their elements once they infuse.

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 96**

Geovishaps will infuse **35s** into the chamber.

Once infused, **Geovishaps** will gain resistance to that element \(30%\).

**Taunt** abilities are particularly effective here to give some time for you to recover stamina.

Attempting to dodge every attack will quickly drain your stamina. Focus on dodging both hits of the **Double Slam** attack, as this does the most damage. Rely on your shields/healing for other damage if you can.

This side is generally harder than **Side 2** since the **Geovishaps** on this side cannot be **Frozen**. Recommended you put your stronger characters here.

![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) Geovishap is immune to freeze

## Chamber 2

**Monster Level - 98**

### **Side 1**

It's fairly difficult to keep the **Cicins** grouped because of their teleport. You will mostly need to clear this chamber fighting one at a time.

Aim the **Electro Cicin** first to get rid of the **Electro Triangle**. The **Cryo Cicin** will mostly ignore you during this time.

**Cryo Cicin** will keep regenerating her shield as long as she has Cicin flies alive. Kill them to slow/stop the recharge.

| [**Shockwave**](../mechanics/auras/rumbling-stone.md)\*\*\*\* | 3349![](../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png) / Wave |

The **Shockwave** aura deals a lot of damage. Prioritize the Ruin Guard with the Aura.

Shoot a Ruin Guard twice in the Eye to disable it, making the fight much easier.

| Monster | HP |

| **Ruin Guard** | ~700K |

#### 3★ Tips

Any **Elemental** based team will be effective against Ruin Guards.

One way to group the Ruin Guards quickly is to stay in the middle and let them come to you, but this is RNG dependent. Moving closer to either Ruin Guard may cause the other to stop and fire a Missile Attack, which makes them group together slower. You might however miss out on some damage standing in the middle too. Pick the strategy that best suits your comp.

Trying to avoid the **Earthquake** aura can be a big time loss due to how often it is on field. It is better to try and Shield/Heal through it and just take the damage if possible. If you try to dodge the wave, try to dodge into a ruin grader. This prevents you from moving further away, but still gives you i-frames that will prevent the damage.

| [**Ice Cage**](../mechanics/auras/ice-cage.md)\*\*\*\* | 6699![](../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) |

Getting caught in **Ice Cage** during a **Ruin Grader** spin attack is lethal. Prioritize the Ruin Guard with the Aura

While it's possible to disable the **Ruin Grader** completely, it's difficult to do in practice and isn't actually that helpful. It's often more effective to just keep attacking them if you stagger them to their knees instead of using that time to shoot their eyes

| \*\*\*\*[**Ruin Grader**](../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-grader.md)\*\*\*\* | ~800K |

#### 3★ Tips

Any **Elemental** based team will be effective against Ruin Graders.

The best way to group the Ruin Graders is to have one charge at you into the other, however this is purely RNG, and you may take some resets before it happens.

Ruin Graders stagger often because of the weak points on their legs. Don't be afraid to stay close and continue attacking them. Their attacks are fairly telegraphed and are best dodged at close range.

Letting a Ruin Grader perform the spin attack is a very large time loss due to how long it lasts. There is a brief window when they are winding up the attack that their legs are exposed. Hitting it during this time will interrupt the attack.
