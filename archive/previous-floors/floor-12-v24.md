# Floor 12 (v2.4)

## Divergence <a href="#general-tips" id="general-tips"></a>

Certain opponents in this challenge possess the **Honed Spirit** effect, which grants them 1**0% Physical and All Elemental RES**.

When opponents with Honed Spirit take hits from attacks that are considered **Normal Attack DMG**, they will lose **3% Physical and All Elemental RES**. A maximum of **30%** of each may be lost this way.&#x20;

The RES lost this way will be reset every 20s.

## General Tips

**Honed Spirit** affects all enemies **on Side 1**.

If you can use **Normal Attacks**, then this divergence is effectively a debuff on enemies, as it will result in a net **-20% RES** at max stacks on the enemy. **Spear** users in particular are good at getting a lot of stacks quickly.

Having strong single target damage on **Side 1** is important when trying to go for stars for Chambers 1 & 2, and **Side 2** for Chamber 3. As usual, if you're having trouble then build a different team for each chamber.

Bosses such as **Primo Geovishap** and **Maguu Kenki** have high damage resistance during their initial animation, however can still be hit with attacks to generate energy and buffs. You can use this time to set up certain effects before the fight begins.

## Chamber 1

**Monster Level - 95**

Make sure you understand the mechanics behind the [#divide](../../monsters/elites/perpetual-mechanical-array.md#divide "mention") phase, otherwise you will struggle for damage.

Make sure you save some of your burst damage for when it goes down, as it takes additional damage during that time. You should aim to kill it during this first downed phase.

If you are close to being able to star, you can save a few seconds by resetting until the enemy in the [#divide](../../monsters/elites/perpetual-mechanical-array.md#divide "mention") is a [ruin-cruiser.md](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-cruiser.md "mention") or [ruin-destroyer.md](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-destroyer.md "mention"), as these have less HP.

Bringing at least one![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)character is essential to break the[pyro-abyss-mage.md](../../monsters/abyss-order/pyro-abyss-mage.md "mention") and [abyss-lector-pyro.md](../../monsters/abyss-order/abyss-lector-pyro.md "mention") shields efficiently, two if possible. You can also use![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)to break shields if you lack![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png).

Aim for the [dendro-samachurl.md](../../monsters/hilichurls/samachurls/dendro-samachurl.md "mention") first in the second wave. The![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png)debuff can drain your health quickly when combined with the other![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)effects.

After that, go for the [pyro-abyss-mage.md](../../monsters/abyss-order/pyro-abyss-mage.md "mention") next to stop the **Smoldering Flames** aura.

If you're having trouble with either damage or surviving, make sure to bring a **Shielder**, as it can both protect you from damage and also do additional damage by reflecting the [#primordial-shower](../../monsters/elites/primo-geovishap.md#primordial-shower "mention") attack.

The [primo-geovishap.md](../../monsters/elites/primo-geovishap.md "mention") will take greatly reduced damage while waking up, however you can still use skills to recharge energy, and also normal attacks to begin stacking **Honed Spirit** debuffs.

See [primo-geovishap.md](../../monsters/elites/primo-geovishap.md "mention") for more tips.

Bringing at least one![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)character is essential to break the [abyss-herald.md](../../monsters/abyss-order/abyss-herald.md "mention") shield efficiently, two if possible. It is also much easier to keep them grouped while **Frozen**. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)can also work, but it is much less effective.

**Chongyun** in particular works well as he can infuse another character with![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png), so he does not need to be invested at all.

The [#cross-slash](../../monsters/abyss-order/abyss-herald.md#cross-slash "mention") attack can increase ability cooldowns, making it harder to break their shields. Try to avoid this attack, or use a **Shield** to block the damage.

Staying close to a wall is a good method to keep them grouped, as they move around a lot with their attacks. This will make it easier to **Freeze** both together for long periods of time.

This side is straightforward if you have AoE to hit both enemies at once on each wave. They will naturally group.

You can bring a **Bow** character to stun them, but it is often not worth the time.

To group the [ruin-grader.md](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-grader.md "mention")s, try your best to be at one of them when they spawn. The other one should then [#charge](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-grader.md#charge "mention") towards you, grouping them. If you do not, they'll often charge in different directions and end up apart for longer.

Make sure you're aware of the invincibility phases so you don't waste damage on it. There is one when it is waking up, and another when it reaches 75% HP.
