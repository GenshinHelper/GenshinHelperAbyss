## Abyss DPS check difficulty

Below is a rough estimate for the amount of DPS required for 3\* on F12-3 for different versions of Abyss. Note that you **should not use the raw numbers**. These should only be used to compare relative strengths between Abyss versions.

**Low DPS** refers to the requirement if you have optimal grouping/rotations, where you are hitting all enemies in a wave at the same time at peak efficiency.

**High DPS** refers to the requirement if you have sub-optimal grouping/rotations, where you are hitting enemies individually.
