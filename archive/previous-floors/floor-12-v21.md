{% hint style="info" %}
The **Samurai** enemies in this chamber **can be picked up with**![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)**skills**, but must be staggered first with other abilities.
{% endhint %}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)is highly recommended to group the enemies on this side. If you do, then this chamber is not challenging.

If you're struggling to get stars with a team built for the later chambers, you should just aim for a clear first and come back later with a team specifically built for this side.

| [Anemo Specter](../../monsters/specters/anemo-specter.md)                          | 227K HP    |
| [Geo Specter](../../monsters/specters/geo-specter.md)                              | 227K HP    |

Run towards the **Eye of the Storm/Stonehide Lawachurl** in each wave to start. They have the higher HP pool, and the **Specters** will naturally move towards you.

Bringing a **Ranged DPS** against the **Eye of the Storm** is highly recommended, as it spends a lot of time floating off the ground which can lose you time. **Yoimiya** in particular is exceptionally good against it. If you don't, bring at least one **archer** as a support so you can interrupt it's airborne attacks.

The waves will not end until the death animation of **Specters** completes. Keep this in mind, as this can add extra seconds to your clears.

| [Maguu Kenki](../../monsters/elites/maguu-kenki.md) | 1.5M HP    |

This is a difficult fight if you're not familiar with the attacks and dodge timings. Check the in depth guide page and practice on the overworld version a few times to get used to it's attacks.

Remember once the **Maguu Kenki** reaches **75% HP** it will become **invulnerable** and perform an \*\*AoE \*\*attack. Make sure not to waste your damage on it during this time.

This is mostly a DPS check, so bring your most invested composition on this side when going for 3★.

| [Cryo Cicin Mage](../../monsters/fatui/cryo-cicin-mage.md) | 383K HP    |

While the **Mirror Maiden** has more HP, go for the **Cryo Cicin Mage** first, which spawns behind you. There is a high chance for the **Mirror Maiden** to teleport to you and group naturally, where the **Cryo Cicin Mage** will not teleport. This also gives you an opportunity to stagger her before she summons her Cicins which let her shield.

Getting **Frozen** can be dangerous, which makes focusing the **Cryo Cicin Mage** preferable as well.

Try your best to avoid **Mirror Maiden's** AoE attacks as long as possible, as this **Polarizes** her and improves her attacks as well as makes her more resistance to CC.

| [Ruin Guard](../../monsters/ruin-constructs/ruin-guard.md) | 643K HP    |

Run towards the **Ruin Guards** immediately. Staying at range will cause them to use **Missiles**, which delays their grouping.

Bring strong AoE characters on this side that can damage both **Ruin Guards** simultaneously. You will want to leave as much time as possible for the second half.

Try to kill both **Ruin Guards** before they go for a **Spin Attack** (roughly **30 seconds** into the fight). This causes a large time loss. If you cannot, consider using **Freeze** to delay this attack, and/or bring an **archer** to stagger them when they go for the attack.

If you're not familiar with this boss, make sure to check out the **In Depth Guide** page ([Perpetual Mechanical Array](../../monsters/elites/perpetual-mechanical-array.md)) for tips. It is important to know which enemy to aim when it **Divides**.

The **Perpetual Mechanical Array** has reduced defenses when stunned. Use the **divide** phase to charge bursts and wait until it is **stunned** to unleash your damage.

You should try to stay close to it throughout the fight, as this limits the attack patterns.

Due to the high HP pool,![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png)**DMG** is highly discouraged. It will be very hard to get stars on this floor with a **PHYS** based DPS. Bring your best **Elemental** based team.
