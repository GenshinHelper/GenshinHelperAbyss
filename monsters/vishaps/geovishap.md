## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Head

Geovishaps can become **infused with an element. Infusion adds elemental effects to attacks, as well as +20% Elemental RES, for a total of 30% RES** in that element.

Once **infused**, they will always carry their element (like **Slimes**). Use this to trigger beneficial reactions against them to your advantage.

While **infused**, Geovishaps are more resistant to **staggering.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png) \*\*infused \*\*Geovishaps can't be **frozen.**

Even though they are resistant to ![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)\*\* \*\*DMG, bringing a **Geo Support** can trigger \*\*Crystallize \*\*once they infuse, giving you shields against their attacks.

Having a \*\*shield \*\*active when they roll into you will cause them to be stunned briefly.

## Abilities

### Double Slam

![Makes two jumping attacks in quick succession](../../.gitbook/assets/geovishap\_stomp.gif)

Dodge out of the way before it lands. The best timing is to dodge just as the red circle reaches the edge.

### Slash

### Punch

### Rolling Slam

![Rolls towards the player, following up with a jump attack](../../.gitbook/assets/geovishap\_roll.gif)

Dodge to the side of the roll, then dodge again when it slams down.

If you are \*\*shielded \*\*when they roll into you, it will stagger them briefly.

Dodging the roll can be difficult. If you are low on stamina, focus on dodging the **jump** portion of the attack, as it does a lore more damage.

If you are able to dodge the roll, it will stagger the Geovishap and prevent the followup jump attack!

### Spikes

![Releases three spikes that follow the player](../../.gitbook/assets/geovishap\_spikes.gif)

### Infusion

![Charges up and infuses itself with an Element](../../.gitbook/assets/geovishap\_infuse\_pyro.gif)

Each Geovishap will always infuse to the same element

#### Pyro Infusion

#### Hydro Infusion

#### Cryo Infusion

![Attacks cause Cryo explosions that deal damage after a delay](../../.gitbook/assets/geovishap\_stomp\_cryo.gif)

#### Electro Infusion
