## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Head

Fighting Geovishap Hatchlings is about persistence and defense. Generally appearing in groups, they have a tendency to be agile yet deadly and several of them attacking together can wipe out a character + a shield in a matter of seconds.&#x20;

It is important to **try to hold a shield** while fighting these enemies. This can be a Zhongli shield or a shield from crystallization reactions or a shield that the hatchlings drop, they all hold the same effect.

**Timing your Q's for the downtime** is also crucial to being able to effectively deal with them and the enemies that follow. It is pointless to attack when they are rolling around. You should also **take advantage of the fact that they teleport** to not run around the field too much. This will also help in keeping several of them together at a time.
