## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

* **Stay** **unshielded** around these enemies as if they attack a shielded character, they will gain a shield themselves
* Slow Attacking so a heavy barrage of elemental reactions will wear them down quickly
