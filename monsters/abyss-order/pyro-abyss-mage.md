## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

You can use the **Teleport** to reposition **Abyss Mages** to your advantage at the start of some abyss chambers.

Once you drop the shield, make sure to focus the **Abyss Mage** so that they stay staggered. The **Dance** attacks deal a lot of damage, and it can be hard to get close to them while they are active.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) attacks will also work, but are **half as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **1/4 as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png).

After the shield is broken, the **Abyss Mage** will be briefly stunned.

See [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md) for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Pyro Abyss Mage** **shield** has **12U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **3\~6** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png) to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring about **6\~12** applications, and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)are even less effective, requiring **12\~24** applications.

Moving a distance away from the **Abyss Mage** will trigger this ability.

The **Abyss Mage** will appear where the player is facing. You can use this to reposition them to your advantage.

### Dance

### Shield

After about **8 seconds** of the **Dance** attack, the **Abyss Mage** will reshield.

Make sure to stagger the **Abyss Mage** in some way if you see it using **Dance** to prevent this from happening.
