## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

**Abyss Lectors** will not move when attacking if you stay close by.

**Abyss Lectors** can be staggered before they shield. You can use this to move them to a favorable position. Once shielded, they can no longer be pushed.

Once **shielded**, try to stay close to the **Abyss Lector** so the **Meteor** attack will land close by. This allows you to use AoE damage to continue hitting both the **shield** and the shard at the same time for maximum damage.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) attacks will also work, but are **half as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **1/4 as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)

See [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md) for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Abyss Lector shield** has **72U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **18\~36** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)is half as effective, requiring between **36\~72** applications to break the shield, and ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)are a quarter as effective, requiring **72\~144** applications.

### Pyro Shield

Summons a Pyro shield, dealing AoE damage in the process
{% endembed %}

Once the **Abyss Lector** drops below a certain **HP**, it will summon a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png) **shield** and deal ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)**DMG** to nearby characters. There is no way to kill the **Abyss Lector** immediately and skip the shield phase.

The **shield** absorbs incoming damage. Destroying the **shield** will immediately kill the **Abyss Lector**, regardless of how much **HP** is left

### Meteor (Shielded)

Summons a meteor which explodes, dealing damage
{% endembed %}

The **Meteor** leaves behind a shard which can be destroyed. Doing so deals additional damage to the **Abyss Lector**'s shield and briefly staggering it.
