## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

You can use the **Teleport** to reposition **Abyss Mages** to your advantage at the start of some abyss chambers.

Once you drop the shield, make sure to focus the **Abyss Mage** so that they stay staggered. The **Dance** attacks deal a lot of damage, and it can be hard to get close to them while they are active.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)to break the shield, as this will **Freeze** the **Abyss Herald**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) attacks will also work, but are less effective than![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **half as effective**.

After the shield is broken, the **Abyss Mage** will be briefly stunned.

See [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md) for more information.
