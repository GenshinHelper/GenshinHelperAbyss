## Resistances

|      Element | Resist |

| ALL ELEMENTS | 0%     |

## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

**Abyss Lectors** will not move when attacking if you stay close by.

**Abyss Lectors** can be staggered before they shield. You can use this to move them to a favorable position. Once shielded, they can no longer be pushed.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png) attacks will also work, but are less effective than![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **half as effective**.

See [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md) for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike other ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)shields, both![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)appear to be equally effective on **Abyss Lector** shields. Use whichever characters you have that apply elements the quickest.
{% endhint %}

Try using **Bennet** with **4pc Thundering Fury**. Every use of his **Elemental Skill** triggers **Overload** on the **Abyss Lector** shields, which reduces the cooldown by **1 second**. Since his elemental skill already has a low cooldown, this lets you use it very frequently to quickly damage the shield.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Abyss Lector shield** has **36U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **18\~36** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring about **45 ticks** of **Electrocharged**, and ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)are half as effective, requiring **36\~72** applications.
{% endhint %}

## Abilities

### Lightning Orbs

Sends three orbs at the player, exploding in an AoE
{% endembed %}

Being hit by an orb will drain your character's energy.

Blocking the damage with a **shield** prevents it from draining your energy.

You can only be affected by the energy drain **once** per set of 3 orbs. Getting hit by all 3 orbs will drain the same amount of energy as getting hit by one.

### Lightning Streak

Sends bolts of lightning in a line at the player.
{% endembed %}

While **shielded**, two streaks are sent at the player.

### Lightning Bolt

Deals damage in an AoE where the player is standing.
{% endembed %}

The number of bolts unleashed during this attack is variable, and based on the **Abyss Lector's health/shield**

| Health                            | Number of Bolts |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Unshielded with over 50% HP       | 1               |
| Unshielded with under 50% HP      | 2               |
| Shielded with over 50% Shield HP  | 3               |
| Shielded with under 50% Shield HP | 4               |

### Explosion

### Electro Shield

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/gleamingconsiderategonolek" %}
Deals damage in an AoE around the Abyss Lector, and creates a shield.
{% endembed %}

Once the **Abyss Lector** drops below a certain **HP**, it will summon a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) **shield** and deal ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)**DMG** to nearby characters. There is no way to kill the **Abyss Lector** immediately and skip the shield phase.

The **shield** absorbs incoming damage. Destroying the **shield** will immediately kill the **Abyss Lector**, regardless of how much **HP** is left

### Charged Orbs

This attack is only performed when **shielded**.

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/serenetotalbeetle" %}
Sends out orbs in a circular pattern, which remain on the field.
{% endembed %}

Being hit by an orb will drain your character's energy.

Orbs will remain on the field for about **3 seconds** before disappearing.
