## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

You can use the **Teleport** to reposition **Abyss Mages** to your advantage at the start of some abyss chambers.

Once you drop the shield, make sure to focus the **Abyss Mage** so that they stay staggered. The **Dance** attacks deal a lot of damage, and it can be hard to get close to them while they are active.

The **Lightning Ring** attack does a significant amount of damage if you stay in the AoE, making these particularly annoying at melee. Use ranged attacks if possible, or break their shield quickly to prevent them from using this attack.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)attacks will also work, but are **slightly less effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **1/2 as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png).

After the shield is broken, the **Abyss Mage** will be briefly stunned.

See [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md) for more information.

This means it takes anywhere between **4\~8** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring about **10 ticks of** Electrocharged, and![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)are even less effective, requiring 8**\~16** applications.
