## Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

## Tips

Try to stagger or kill the **Samachurl** before it can summon the **Pillar**. Having to deal with raised enemies can be a significant time loss.

You can knock off the **Samachurl** from the pillar with a headshot from a Bow user, or other attacks that throw enemies back. This is much faster than actually trying to destroy the pillar with attacks.

Killing the **Samachurl** will immediately remove any pillars still remaining.
