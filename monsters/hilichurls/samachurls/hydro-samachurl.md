## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

In chambers with a **Hydro Samachurl**, make sure to aim for them first as their **Healing Rain** heals very quickly.

Some chambers contain multiple **Hydro Samachurls** which can sometimes heal each other. In these situations, try to burst one down as quickly as possible. Another technique is to try and group them together and continually stagger both with attacks and prevent them from casting **Healing Rain**.

## Abilities

### Healing Rain

The AoE is centered on an enemy, and follows them wherever they go.

Killing this enemy will stop the rain.
