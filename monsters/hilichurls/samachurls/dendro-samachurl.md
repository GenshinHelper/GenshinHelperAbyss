### Burning

**Dendro Samachurls** will inflict![](../../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png)on the character, which can react with![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)to cause **Burning**, dealing damage over time.

## Tips

Be careful using characters that apply![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)to your own characters like **Bennett** and **Xinyan**, as this will often inflict **Burning** on yourself, dealing immense damage.

Stay as close to the **Samachurl** as possible to prevent it using it's vine attacks.

It's a good idea to aim **Dendro Samachurls** quickly, as their vine attacks are extremely annoying and time wasting. They are also put in chambers with![](../../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)enemies as well, which make them more dangerous.
