## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

Since **Totems** cannot be destroyed, focus on these **Samachurls** to prevent the arena from being covered in totems.

## Abilities

Totems stay on the field for **35 seconds**.

They are immune to damage and cannot be destroyed in any way.

Totems do not deal any damage until activated by **Thunder Dance**.

### Thunder Dance

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/samevaluableguineafowl" %}
Causes pulses of electro to release from the Samachurl and any active totems
{% endembed %}

Pulses occur every **2 seconds**.

The dance will also activate totems created by other **Electro Samachurls** as well.

You can interrupt them to stop this attack.
