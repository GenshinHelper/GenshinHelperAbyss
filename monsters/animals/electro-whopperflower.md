## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Head

Stunning the **Whopperflower** by breaking it's **Shield** reduces all resistances by **25%**, making it much easier to damage. Prioritize doing this whenever you see it perform this attack, and prioritize damaging it during it's stunned phase.

Using **environmental damage** from certain ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) attacks can be very effective against **Whopperflowers** as it is not affected by their high resistance.

If there are other enemies, it can often be better to focus those first and ignore the **Whopperflowers** until they **shield**, as they have higher resistances until stunned. They will also **Burrow** towards you frequently, so will often group up by themselves.

Beware of abilities apply![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)to your character \(e.g. **Bennett**\). This will cause you to get **Overloaded** when hit by any of the **Electro Whopperflower's** attacks, sending your character flying.

## Abilities

### Shock Mines

Mines will remain on the field for **6 seconds**.

Avoid fighting close to these, as they can repeatedly damage and knock back your character.

### Spin Attack

This attack will only be used if the player is close by.

### Shield

In order to shield, the **Whopperflower** consumes a charge of crystal. If they have no crystals, they cannot use this attack.

After **5 seconds** if the shield is not fully broken, the **Whopperflower** will perform a **Barrage** attack.

Breaking the shield will temporarily **stun** the **Whopperflower**, which also reduces all resitances by **25%**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)is most effective at breaking shields. Other elements will also work, but are less effective \(see [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md)\).

### Laser

Getting hit by this attack will send your character flying. Make sure to prioritize breaking the shield. You can also dodge at the right time to completely avoid the attack.
