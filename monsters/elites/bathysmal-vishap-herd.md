## Mechanics

There are some **Walls** around the arena which can be used by the **Bolteater**![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)**Vishap** for attacks. These can be damaged, and will also be destroyed once one Vishap begins to **Swim**.

## Tips

Keep an eye out for the **Drain** attacks. When both are on the field, this will often completely empty the energy of the active character and make them take damage. Try to kill one quickly to avoid having to deal with two of these attacks.

The Vishaps are much less dangerous when **Swimming**, so if you are having issues, focusing on one Vishap first is best.

## Abilities (Solo)

These attacks are done independently by each Vishap, dealing DMG of the corresponding elemental type.

### Drain

Shoots a orb, dealing elemental DMG and draining Energy
{% endembed %}

This attack will drain **30 energy** per orb. You will still lose energy even if you block the damage with shields.

If the player does not have enough **energy**, they will instead take DMG. This damage goes through shields.

### Tail Swipe

The attacks differ slightly for each type of Vishap.

### Swim

Swims around the arena, periodically shooting missiles at the player
{% endembed %}

Once a Vishap is brought down, it will begin swimming around the Arena.

This will destroy any **Walls** around the arena which are normally used by the **Bolteater**![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) **Geovishap**, making it unable to use those attacks.

{% endembed %}

### Elemental Breath

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/impishappropriateankole" %}
Leaps into the middle of the arena, and unleashes beams that sweep across the arena
{% endembed %}

This attack is only used once you bring one Vishap down to 0. After this, the injured Vishap will begin to **Swim.**

## **Abilities (Rimebiter)**

### **Slash Combo**

## Abilities (Bolteater)

### Wall Climb

{% endembed %}

The orbs will drain energy like the standard **Drain** attack.

The wall can be destroyed with attacks that affect![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png). The Vishap will fall to the ground and be momentarily disabled.
