Dendro Hypostasis Poison Attack: Shoots out three waves of two, three, and four projectiles, which on landing produce zones that deal Dendro DMG when stepped https://gfycat.com/shockingcleverafghanhound Whip Attack: Slashes in front, then around itself twice, dealing Dendro DMG. The enemy is vulnerable after this attack. https://gfycat.com/hoarsevalideastrussiancoursinghounds Bounce Attack: Transforms into a ball, then leaps up in the air and crashes into the ground three times, dealing Dendro DMG, with the AoE of the third crash being larger. The enemy is vulnerable after this attack. https://gfycat.com/narroworangeflickertailsquirrel If Pyro is applied to the enemy during this attack, the ball burns off and the attack ends. https://gfycat.com/generaloptimalisabellineshrike Branch Attack: Leaves itself vulnerable, then generates two waves of two branches from the ground, which deal Dendro DMG once on creation and again after a short delay when they grow spikes. The enemy becomes invulnerable after this attack. https://gfycat.com/leadingidolizeddeer If Pyro is applied to the branches during this attack, they will burn and disappear. https://gfycat.com/chiefmagnificentfinwhale Ring Attack: Leaves itself vulnerable, then generates a ring around the arena which deals Dendro DMG on contact. These rings are replaced with progressively smaller ones until after the third ring, when the enemy explodes, dealing Dendro DMG. The enemy becomes invulnerable after this attack. https://gfycat.com/welllitfakedog If Pyro is applied to a segment of the ring, it will burn and disappear. https://gfycat.com/legalremoteantbear Revival Phase: Protects itself, then generates three Restorative Piths which start out Scorched. Applying Dendro to the Restorative Piths activates them, causing a meter to charge up continuously. Applying Pyro to an Activated Restorative Pith scorches it, preventing it from charging the meter. Applying Electro to an Activated Restorative Pith increases the rate at which it charges the meter. Further applying Dendro to the enemy itself during this period charges the meter for each application. If the meter is filled within a certain duration, the enemy is defeated; if the meter is not filled, its charge level is saved and the enemy restores some of its HP. For Travelers who have no Dendro characters that are more effective, this can be done in a single revival phase using the Traveler (Dendro) and Electro characters or Collei. Traveler (Dendro) without Electro (very difficult to do in a single phase): https://gfycat.com/impossiblevigilantelectriceel Traveler (Dendro) with Electro: https://gfycat.com/oblongpeskyekaltadeta Collei without Electro: https://gfycat.com/masculineplainankolewatusi Collei with Electro: https://gfycat.com/cluelessregalamericanlobster
