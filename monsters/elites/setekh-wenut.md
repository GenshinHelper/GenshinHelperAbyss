## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

The Setekh Wenut will spend a lot of time underground. It's highly recommended you bring a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png) **Bow** character in order to destroy **Windbite Bullets** to give you a good window to do damage while also reducing resists. Make sure to bring an element that corresponds to your main damage type(s).

Most of the attacks are very easy to dodge, so the boss isn't particularly dangerous. However in Abyss, you need to make use of it's vulnerability windows in order to complete it in time for stars.

### Burrow

The Wenut will periodically burrow into the ground following some attacks, changing its attack patterns. It is much less vulnerable during this time, so try to save your damage for when it is above ground and has larger windows for damage.

### Windbite Bullets

The Wenut will periodically summon six Anemo orbs that float in the air for about **5 seconds**. These can react with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)and explode. The element used to explode the orb will decrease the Wenut's resistance by **45%**, bringing it to -20% total.

If you fail to destroy **2 orbs** during this attack, the Wenut will absorb them back and fire a circular volley of bullets onto the area and **Burrow**.

The positions of the Windbite Bullets are always the same, and only one can be reached by melee attacks. Abilities will also tend to the Wenut as well. Bringing a **Bow** character is the most consistent way of destroying the orbs.

Once you **destroy 2 orbs**, the Wenut will be stunned by approximately **10 seconds**, after which it will **Burrow** back into the ground. Once it burrows, the resistance debuff will be removed.
