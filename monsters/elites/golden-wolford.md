# Golden Wolford

|      Element | Resist |
| -----------: | ------ |
| ALL ELEMENTS | 25%    |

## Mechanics

**Weak point** - Head.

### Corrosion

When hit by any attack, applies **Corrosion** to the entire party.

**Corrosion** causes the character to lose a certain **%HP** every second. This loss bypasses any shields.

Corrosion can stack, with each stack draining about **1% HP** every second.

## Tips

Ranged characters are recommended, as the **Golden Wolflord** spends a lot of time moving/flying. If you are using melee, make sure to take advantage of the vulnerable windows after certain attacks.

Abilities that hit multiple times can add multiple **Corrosion** stacks, so prioritize avoiding those.

This is triggered when the Wolflord reaches **66% HP**.

Each wolf skull can be charged up by elemental attacks. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png) is the most effective, taking 2-3 hits to fully charge. Other elements work, but are much less effective.

Once destroyed, the skulls fly back to the Wolflord, dealing damage to the shield.
