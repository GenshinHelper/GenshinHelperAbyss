## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

While it is vulnerable, the **Hydro Hypostasis** will be infused with![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)during and after some attacks. It is only vulnerable to attacks while infused with![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)**DMG** is the most effective against the **Hydro Hypostasis**, as you will always be able to trigger **Vaporize **on your attacks, giving **1.5x** on your attacks at a minimum.![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)can also be used to trigger **Electrocharged**, but is less recommended than![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**DMG** cannot freeze the **Hydro Hypostasis**, but it is effective at freezing the minions it produces and make it easier to prevent revival.

### Rolling Waves

Dives into the ground, creating a wall of rolling cubes which go towards the Hypostasis
{% endembed %}

There will be small gaps between the sections. Escape quickly between them to avoid the ability, as the gaps will close as they get close to the Hypostasis.

### Dolphin Dive

Transforms into a pod of dolphins and dives quickly at the player
{% endembed %}

The Hypostasis will **not** be vulnerable after this attack.

### Dolphin Show

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/informalregulariberianmidwifetoad" %}
Summons dolphins that dive up underneath the player
{% endembed %}

The Hypostasis is **vulnerable **for the duration of this attack. Run into the circle and continue attacking throughout this attack.

### Fin Slam

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/soggylimiteddeer" %}
Transforms into a tail fin, smashing the ground and sending out a shockwave
{% endembed %}

### Summon Slimes

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/pettymessyeastrussiancoursinghounds" %}
Summons two slimes to support the Hypostasis
{% endembed %}

The **light blue** slime will heal the Hypostasis, so focus it first.

The **dark blue** slime can be ignored, but will explode on you for damage.

### Dive

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/rashwastefuldachshund" %}
Dives into the ground, appearing elsewhere
{% endembed %}

The Hypostasis will **not** be vulnerable after this attack.

### **Summon Droplets**

Sends out three Water Droplets that will recombine with and heal the Hypostasis
{% endembed %}

Destroy the **Water Droplets** before they reach the Hypostasis. Any droplet that returns will cause the Hypostasis to revive and heal some HP.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)is effective at stopping the **Water Droplets**, but you will still need to kill them quickly as they come from different directions.
