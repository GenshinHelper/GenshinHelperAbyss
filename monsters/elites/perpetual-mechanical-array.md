## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

The **Perpetual Mechanical Array** have extremely high ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) **RES**. Avoid using a![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png)based DPS. If you do, always bring **Superconduct** ( ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)+![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) ) to reduce their resistance by **40%.**

Most of the **Perpetual Mechanical Array's** attacks can be dodged easily at the right time. Learn the attack timings so you can focus on dealing damage.

When **divided**, make sure to focus the right construct. You should try focus it down as fast as possible, as the attacks of the other constructs together can be quite deadly. If you struggle with damage, consider saving some burst damage for this phase.

While they are invulnerable, the other constructs are still able to be **stunned** using their normal means. If you're having issues with this phase, keep an eye on the attacks of the other constructs and stun them where possible.

The **Perpetual Mechanical Array** has reduced defenses when stunned. Use the **divide** phase to charge bursts and wait until it is **stunned** to unleash your damage.

## Abilities

### Rocket

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/pastelslightibadanmalimbe" %}
Transforms into a rocket, flying into the air and landing on the player for Physical DMG
{% endembed %}

Simply dodge out when the AoE indicator appears to avoid the attack.

### Laser

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/smugdeterminedlcont" %}
Charges up and fires a laser beam that follows the player, dealing Physical DMG
{% endembed %}

The Laser has a minimum range. If you get close to the **Perpetual Mechanical Array** it will interrupt this attack early.

### Orbital Strike

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/uniquedeficientalligator" %}
Beam tracks the player for a while, before firing in an AoE for Physical DMG
{% endembed %}

Dodge out of the way when you see the AoE indicator to avoid the attack.

### Blade Spin

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/majormenacinghaddock" %}
Turns into a sawblade and rushes at the player
{% endembed %}

Only used when player is close to the **Perpetual Mechanical Array**.

### Sword Slam

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/impossiblepointlessinvisiblerail" %}
Turns into a sword and slashes down at the player
{% endembed %}

Only used when player is close to the **Perpetual Mechanical Array**.

### Dice Roll

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/masculinecheapimago" %}
Turns into a cube, and rushes at the player
{% endembed %}

Once it reaches a player, performs an AoE slam after a delay.

This ability is only used when the player is far from the **Perpetual Mechanical Array**, so is not commonly seen.

### Divide

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/dearestdeficientchital" %}
Splits off into four Ruin constructs
{% endembed %}

This ability is used after **40 seconds**, or if the **Perpetual Mechanical Array** is brought below a certain threshold of HP.

The main body is **invulnerable** during this phase.

One of each of the following are spawned:

* [Ruin Cruiser](../ruin-constructs/ruin-cruiser.md)
* [Ruin Defender](../ruin-constructs/ruin-defender.md)
* [Ruin Destroyer](../ruin-constructs/ruin-destroyer.md)
* [Ruin Scout](../ruin-constructs/ruin-scout.md)

One cube will be **highlighted**.

The spawned construct will have an **aura** around it too.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pma\_highlight.png)

This is the weak construct, and **killing this will end the Divide phase immediately**, and cause the **Perpetual Mechanical Array** to become disabled for **20 seconds**. The other constructs can be stunned, but are invulnerable to damage and cannot be destroyed.

While **stunned**, it will have **-50% RES**, making it much more vulnerable to damage.

### Reconstruct

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/classicloathsomegoral" %}
Reforms into a single cube
{% endembed %}

After **20 seconds** of being stunned, it will reform into the cube and use it's regular moveset.
