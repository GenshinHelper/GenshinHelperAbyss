# Oceanid

## Resistances

Oceanid itself takes no damage.

## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

The Oceanid is defeated by killing all the mimics in stages.

See: [mimics](../mimics/ "mention")

In addition, it can make the stage fall (either 1 or 2 portions of it) every other turn. Once defeated, it releases a giant hydro explosion attack dealing massive AOE damage.
