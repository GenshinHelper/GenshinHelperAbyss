## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

Make sure you bring at least one![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)character with you so you can break ASIMON's invisibility phase. While you can still hit it while invisible, it will have greatly increased RES so you should prioritize breaking it.

If your team composition allows it, having both![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png)to inflict **Quicken** on ASIMON is the fastest way to break invisibility. See below for more details

### Invisibility

At the start of the fight, ASIMON will turn invisible and send out components to attack you.

This is ASIMON's primary mode, and you should prioritize ending it before doing damage. There are two ways to do so:

* Damage the **Primal Construct Parts** that are sent out to attack you. They cannot be destroyed, but when they run out of HP they will enter **recovery**. Using an![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)attack during this time will paralyze ASIMON and break invisibility.
* Hit the invisible ASIMON directly with a **Quicken** reaction (![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)+![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png))

{% endembed %}

Running behind ASIMON can help you dodge this attack.

### Repulsor

## Abilities (Charged)
