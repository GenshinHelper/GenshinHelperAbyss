## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

When the **Maguu Kenki** first drops below **75% HP**, it will perform a **Ground Strike** after which it will infuse attacks with![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)**DMG**, and begin to use **Phantom** attacks. The color of the **Phantom** determines whether it will deal ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)or![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**DMG**. The **Maguu Kenki** is invulnerable to damage during this transition.

It is recommended you use a **melee** character to avoid its **Block** ability.

The attacks are fairly telegraphed and easy to avoid, particularly at range. However, due to the **Block** ability you will mostly be fighting at melee range, which can make this a tricky fight if you are trying to go quickly. Using **Bursts** to i-frame through major attacks is preferable as it allows you to stay close for damage while still avoiding attacks.

## Abilities

### Block

Attacks at **melee** range will not trigger the shield.

**Taunt** abilities can also be used to draw its attention and attack from behind.

### Dash

### Exploding Mask

The attack will follow the player for a short duration. Dodge out of the way once it stops moving.

### **Pushing Mask**

### Ground Strike

**Maguu Kenki** will use this attack when you first drop it below **75% HP**, after which it will infuse itself with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png) begin to use **Phantom** attacks which deal ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) .

You can **dodge** the attack with the right timing, or use a **Burst** to i-frame through the damaging portion. Otherwise, avoid it by running outside of the AoE.

### Rush

Dodge to the side with the right timing to avoid this attack. You can use the glow from the sword hilt as an indicator for the right timing.

#### Phantom: Rush Combo

**Maguu Kenki** will perform:

* An infused **Rush** attack.
* A single slash, while a **Phantom** performs a **Triple Strike.**
* Finishing with **Pushing Mask.**

Dodge to the side to avoid the **Rush** and **Pushing Mask** attacks as normal. The sword attacks are easily avoided by staying away.

### Whirlwind Slash

#### Phantom: Whirlwind Slash

### Phantom: Ranged Slash

**Maguu Kenki** will turn and continue aiming at the player for the duration of this attack. Make sure to be constantly running to the side to avoid this attack.

Getting caught by the initial slice\(s\) can be deadly, as they can stagger you if you take enough damage, leaving you vulnerable to the followup attacks. Make sure to dodge and/or save a **Burst** to avoid this attack if possible.
