## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

The **Thunder Manifestation** will continually be infused with![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png). ![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)work particularly well as their reactions will deal damage to it.

There is no way to avoid the **Enraged** state, and it happens at a fairly low HP threshold. It is best to just continually attack it and get it down below **75% HP** rather than avoiding it's first set of moves.

When using **Enrage**, the **Thunder Manifestation** will fly slightly into the air, but can still be hit as long as your abilities can reach.

The **Thunder Manifestation** floats a bit above the ground, and will move into the air briefly with some abilities, making melee abilities hard to land. It also frequently uses abilities that travel around the arena. Ranged characters, particularly **Bow** wielders are recommended.

## Fury

The **Thunder Manifestation** has a **Fury** gauge that builds with some attacks, or when it reaches **75% HP**. Once it is full, it will become **Enraged** and have a different moveset.

## Abilities (Normal)

The **Thunder Manifestation** will cycle through these abilities one by one in order until the **Fury** gauge is maxed.

### Strike Probes

Sends out five lightning probes in a circle
{% endembed %}

The probes will periodically activate, causing ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)**DMG** and building **Fury**.

### Lightning Strikes

Sends out two sets of lightning bolts around the arena, centered on the player
{% endembed %}

### Charging Blast

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/unluckythoroughbeaver" %}
Deals damage in an AoE around the Thunder Manifestation, building Fury
{% endembed %}

This removes the **Strike Probes** from the arena.

Staying inside the AoE of this ability will fully charge the **Fury** meter.

### Enrage

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/cornydescriptivebluebird" %}
Charges up and blasts the arena, dealing Electro damage
{% endembed %}

This ability is used when the **Fury** gauge is maxed, causing the **Thunder Manifestation** to become **Enraged**.

### Lightning Prison

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/dearestflawlessbluefintuna" %}
After a brief delay, summons a prison of lightning which follows the player
{% endembed %}

Characters caught inside will continuously take![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)**DMG**.

The **Thunder Manifestation** will continue to perform attacks while the prison is active.
