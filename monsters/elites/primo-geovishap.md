## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

Primo Geovishaps are very tanky, bring **high single target dps to defeat them in a timely manner.**

Their attacks deal high damage so **bringing a shield** and/or **consistently dodging correctly** is crucial (more info on this below). While bringing a healer is recommended, it is often not enough to counteract the high damage taken from attacks.

Shields are particularly important as you can reflect their **Primordial Shower** attack for additional damage. You can use the shards dropped by the Primo Geovishap to do this, but it is a lot less reliable than using a character than can shield.

If the active character is **shielded** when the attack hits, it will cause the Primo Geovishap to take damage as well.

If the shield is the same element or![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png), damage will be increased.

Bringing a shield character is recommended so you can consistently reflect this attack for additional damage. You can also use **Crystallize** shards that drop during the fight, but it is a lot less reliable. Occasionally they drop right underneath the Primo Geovishap and it will be in the way of collecting them.

### Elemental Breath

Sweeps back and forth in front of the Primo Geovishap in a line

### Elemental Stones

Sends out several stones in the arena which explode after some time, dealing DMG
{% endembed %}

Each element has a slight variation in the explosion, but they all will deal AoE DMG of the infused element.

When low on health, the Primo Geovishap will use a powered up version of this attack, sending out more stones.
