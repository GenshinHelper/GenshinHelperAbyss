## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Head

Make sure you do not use your damaging skills when it is first waking up, as it has greatly increased resistance. You can use this time to charge up energy though if you like.

Primo Geovishaps are very tanky, bring **high single target dps to defeat them in a timely manner.**

Their attacks deal high damage so **bringing a shield** and/or **consistently dodging correctly** is crucial (more info on this below). While bringing a healer is recommended, it is often not enough to counteract the high damage taken from attacks.

Shields are particularly important as you can reflect their **Primordial Shower** attack for additional damage. You can use the shards dropped by the Primo Geovishap to do this, but it is a lot less reliable than using a character than can shield.

Staying close to the Primo Geovishap is the best way to defeat it quickly, as long as you can avoid it's attacks by dodging or shielding.

Charges up and unleashes a giant AoE wave

If the active character is **shielded** when the attack hits, it will cause the Primo Geovishap to take damage as well.

If the shield is the same element or![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png), damage will be increased.

Bringing a shield character is recommended so you can consistently reflect this attack for additional damage. You can also use **Crystallize** shards that drop during the fight, but it is a lot less reliable. Occasionally they drop right underneath the Primo Geovishap and it will be in the way of collecting them.
