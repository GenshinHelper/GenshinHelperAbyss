## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Core

Bring a bow user so you can easily hit the Corolla when the core is there. You can also time it during it's ground attacks, but the window is much smaller.

Consider bringing a shield character if you struggle with charged bow attacks. It can be easy to get interrupted and chain staggered while aiming.

The attacks are very telegraphed, so get used to dodging them. Most of the ranged attacks can be dodged simple by moving sideways around the Regisvine during them.

### Core

The Regisvine will produce a core that will alternate between it's Corolla (face) and it's Roots (base).

While the core is active, the Regisvine gets **+300% ALL RES**, massively reducing all damage. You should focus on breaking the core before using any damaging skills.

To use the shield, you will need to use elements that react with![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png)are the most effective elements. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)will also work but are less effective.

When the Core is first created, a flower will be produced on the arena. When the Regisvine shifts the Core, a second flower will be produced.

If both the flowers are active, they will combine and create a massive explosion.

The flowers can be destroyed using elemental reactions. Usually you should ignore it and focus instead of breaking the Core and dealing damage.

If your damage is low, you will want to destroy the flowers to avoid triggering the explosion.
