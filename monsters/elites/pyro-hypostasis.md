## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

The **Cryo Hypostasis** is continually infused with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)when the vulnerable.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) **DMG** is the most effective against the **Pyro Hypostasis**, as you will always be able to trigger **Vaporize** on your attacks, giving **2x** on your attacks at a minimum.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) **DMG** is the also effective against the **Pyro Hypostasis**, as you will always be able to trigger **Melt** on your attacks, giving **1.5x** on your attacks at a minimum, however note that![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**should not be used for shieldbreaking**.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) attacks will also work, but are **half as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **1/4 as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png).

After the shield is broken, the **Pyro Hypostasis** will enter the **Extinguished** state and be weaker.

For more information, see [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Pyro Hypostasis** **shield** has **28U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **7~14** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring about **14~28** applications, and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)are even less effective, requiring **28~48** applications.
