## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

While it is **Extinguished**, the **Pyro Hypostasis** will be infused with![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png)during and after some attacks. It is only vulnerable to attacks while infused with![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) **DMG** is the most effective against the **Pyro Hypostasis**, as you will always be able to trigger **Vaporize** on your attacks, giving **2x** on your attacks at a minimum.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png) **DMG** is also effective against the **Pyro Hypostasis**, as you will always be able to trigger **Melt** on your attacks, giving **1.5x** on your attacks at a minimum, however note that![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)**should not be used for shieldbreaking**.

The **Pyro Hypostasis** is very dangerous while **Ignited**. Make sure you bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)to get the shield down as quickly as possible.

## Shield

Prefer![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)attacks to break through the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png) attacks will also work, but are **half as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **1/4 as effective** as![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png).

After the shield is broken, the **Pyro Hypostasis** will enter the **Extinguished** state and be weaker.

For more information, see [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Pyro Hypostasis** **shield** has **28U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **7~14** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png) to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring about **14~28** applications, and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)are even less effective, requiring **28~48** applications.

## Abilities \(Ignited\)

### Flame Dive

### Cobra Strike

### Ground Pound

### Rolling Attack

Dodging sideways is the most effective way to avoid it.

### EXPLOSION!

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/somberlastingkinkajou" caption="Charges up for a long time, after which it explodes for massive damage." %}

Due to how long the charge time is, you should not simply wait out the attack. Continue attacking it during the charge time and try to break the shield, which will interrupt the attack.

If it is about to explode, use a **Burst** to i-frame the explosion if necessary.

## Abilities \(Extinguished\)

### Pillars

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/inbornodditalianbrownbear" caption="Pillars shoot up from the ground" %}

The pillars have a minimum range. Standing close to the **Pyro Hypostasis** can avoid this attack.

The **Hypostasis** is vulnerable for the duration of the attack.

After this attack, the **Hypostasis** will use **Tinders**.

### Missiles

The **Hypostasis** can be damaged while in the air if you have ranged attacks.

### Tinders \(Reshield\)

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/tallantiqueblobfish" caption="Summons 3 Tinders, which recharge the shield unless destroyed" %}

The **shield** needs a total of **6 charges** to fully recharge. The **Pyro Hypostasis** will gain **1 charge** from finishing this ability, and an additional **2 charges** for every **Tinder** that is not destroyed.

Once the cube reaches 6 charges, it will **Reignite**

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/weirdmerryharvestmouse" %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Each **Tinder** has **2U** of strength. This means any ![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro_small.png)ability will immediately destroy one. ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro_small.png)is slightly less effectively, requiring **1~2** applications, and![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo_small.png)are even less effective, requiring **2~4** applications.
