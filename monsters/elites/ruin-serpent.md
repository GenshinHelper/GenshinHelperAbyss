{% hint style="info" %}
The following page is for the Abyss version of the Ruin Serpent only, which does not contain any mechanics using the Lumenstone, so is slightly easier than the overworld version.
{% endhint %}

## Mechanics <a href="#mechanics" id="mechanics"></a>

**Weak point** - None (except in charging phase)

### Charging Attacks

Both [#meteor-storm](ruin-serpent.md#meteor-storm "mention") and [#laser](ruin-serpent.md#laser "mention") attacks have a charging portion. During this time, the Ruin Serpent will expose 4 glowing cores which are weak points. Destroying all 4 of these during the charge will briefly disable the Ruin Serpent and interrupt the attack.

During this time, the Ruin Serpent will have its damage resistances significantly increased, so make sure to save your damage if you can for when it is paralyzed.

## Tips <a href="#tips" id="tips"></a>

The Abyss variant spends less time underground, so you have more windows to deal damage than you would with the overworld version.

Fast hitting auto-attacks are a great way to destroy the exposed cores. Sword and spear users are excellent for this.

Charging attacks can be particularly deadly, so try to stay close to the Ruin Serpent and interrupt the attack.

## Abilities <a href="#abilities" id="abilities"></a>
