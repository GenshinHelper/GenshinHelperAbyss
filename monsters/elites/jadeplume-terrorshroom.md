## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

The Jadeplume Terrorshroom behaves differently from other mushroom type enemies when hit with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)or![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png). See **Activated/Scorched** for more details.

While exhausted, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom has significantly reduced resistances. It is recommended you bring one or more![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)characters to quickly apply![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)to **activate** the Terrorshroom, and to avoid![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)damage, which will lower the Enrage bar.

### Activated/Scorched

When hit by![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png), fills the enrage bar. When it is full, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom will become **activated**, triggering a single powered up attack before falling down and becoming exhausted. While exhausted, the terrorshroom has **-25% ALL RES**. This lasts 15 seconds.

When hit by![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png), lowers the enrage bar. If it is already empty, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom will become **scorched**. This triggers the **Summon Mushrooms** attack, after which the Terrorshroom will return to normal status.
