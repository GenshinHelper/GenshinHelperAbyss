|      Element | Resist |
| -----------: | ------ |
| ALL ELEMENTS | 25%    |

## Mechanics

**Weak point** - Head.

### Corrosion

When hit by any attack, applies **Corrosion** to the entire party.

**Corrosion** causes the character to lose a certain **%HP** every second. This loss bypasses any shields.

### Rage

When hit by their **same element**, the **Rage** meter will increase. When it is full, the **Rifthound** will become **Enraged**, increasing **DMG** but setting their resistance to their corresponding element to **-10% RES**.

## Tips

**Rifthounds** come in different elements (currently ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)/![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)). The attack patterns for each are the same. The element varies the type of **DMG** they do, as well as the type of element they absorb for **Rage**. In general, you should use the same element against the corresponding **Rifthound**.

Trigger **Enrage** as quickly as you can, and then finish off the **Rifthound** quickly using burst damage.

If you find yourself dying to **Corrosion**, bring healers that can heal an entire party at once like **Barbara** or **Jean**.

The **Rifthound** only uses this attack if the player is far away.

### Enrage

Empowers the Rifthound, but reduces RES
{% endembed %}

While **Enraged**, the **Rifthound's** attacks are powered up, but has their resistance to that element set to **-40% RES**.

Use teams that have the same type as the targeted **Rifthound** and trigger this as soon as possible. The defense reduction is significant, and you should be able to finish it off fairly quickly.
