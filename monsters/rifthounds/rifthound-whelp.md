## Mechanics

**Weak point** - Head.

### Corrosion

When hit by any attack, applies **Corrosion** to the entire party.

**Corrosion** causes the character to lose a certain **%HP** every second. This loss bypasses any shields.

### Devourer

When hit by their **same element**, the **Rage** meter will increase. When it is full, the **Rifthound** will enter the **Devourer** state, increasing **DMG** but setting their resistance to their corresponding element to **-10% RES**.

## Tips

**Rifthound Whelps** come in different elements (currently ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)/![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)). The attack patterns for each are the same. The element varies the type of **DMG** they do, as well as the type of element they absorb for **Rage**. In general, you should use the same element against the corresponding **Rifthound Whelp**.

Trigger **Enrage** as quickly as you can, and then finish off the **Rifthound Whelp** quickly using burst damage.

If you find yourself dying to **Corrosion**, bring healers that can heal an entire party at once like **Barbara** or **Jean**.

While **Enraged**, the **Rifthound Whelp's** attacks are powered up, but has their resistance to that element set to **-10% RES**.

Use teams that have the same type as the targeted **Rifthound Whelp** and trigger this as soon as possible. The defense reduction is significant, and you should be able to finish it off fairly quickly.
