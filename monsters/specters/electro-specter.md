## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - None

## Rage <a href="#rage" id="rage"></a>

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.
