## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

Focusing these first as they can heal allies.

**Healing Blast** is centered on the player. This can make the **Hydro Specter** difficult at **melee** range, as the attack can also heal itself. Use ranged attacks or burst them down quickly to prevent losing time to healing.

While **enraged**, they will stop using their heal. You may want to intentionally fill their **Fury Gauge** to stop them from healing.

As of v2.8, specters are now able to be pulled by![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)skills when not Enraged, meaning it is much easier to group them
{% endhint %}

## Rage

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.

The ability can also heal itself.
