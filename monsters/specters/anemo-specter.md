## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

Use ranged attacks or burst them down quickly to prevent losing time to healing.

## Rage

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.

If **enraged**, the **DMG** and **AoE** are larger, and it leaves behind a vortex which deals damage over time.
