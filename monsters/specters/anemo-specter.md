## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

While not dangerous by themselves, the vacuum they leave behind can combo with other enemies. Try to avoid enraging them if they are combined with other monsters with hard hitting attacks.

{% hint style="info" %}
As of v2.8, specters are now able to be pulled by![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)skills when not Enraged, meaning it is much easier to group them

## Rage

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.

If **enraged**, the **DMG** and **AoE** are larger, and it leaves behind a vortex which deals damage over time.
