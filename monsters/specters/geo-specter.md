## Tips and Mechanics

{% hint style="info" %}
As of v2.8, specters are now able to be pulled by![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)skills when not Enraged, meaning it is much easier to group them
{% endhint %}

## Rage

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.

## Abilities

### Triple Shot

Fires three missiles that curve towards the player
{% endembed %}

The missiles do not follow the player directly, but will curve. They are fairly fast however, so you will need to be moving or dodging to avoid them.

### Charge

Rushes towards the player with a spinning attack
{% endembed %}

This will only be used when the player is close by.

### Pulse (Enraged)

Deals damage in an AoE
{% endembed %}

### Detonate

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/colossalclassickitty" %}
Explodes in a small AoE once killed

If **enraged**, the **DMG** and **AoE** are larger.
