## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - None

As with most![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)enemies, be careful when they are mixed with![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)where they can **Freeze** you.

This **Specter** is particularly annoying when **Enraged**. The **Barrage** hits several times, and the DoT leftover with **Detonate** can apply![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)to you even after it's gone. Avoid triggering it if possible.

## Rage

Specters have a **Fury Gauge** which builds up when hit by attacks that take a large portion of the Specter's HP.

When **enraged**, they will change their attack patterns, deal more damage, and explode in a larger AoE when killed.

If **enraged**, the explosion leaves behind a field which deals ![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)**DMG** every **0.5s**.
