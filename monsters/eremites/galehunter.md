## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

When stunned, Eremite Galehunters get **-60%**​![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)**RES**.

Like other humanoid enemies, you can CC them with​![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-68e4777d7c38eb974be29d8260b1f52709a44a26%2Fanemo\_small.png?alt=media\&token=e3a6e092-2359-45e8-a8cc-20499cfb0eac)skills, making them much easier to deal with.

While enhanced, the Galehunters have increased resistances. Focus on the summoned bird first and prioritize killing it before turning back to the Galehunter.

### Enhanced State <a href="#enhanced-state" id="enhanced-state"></a>

When HP drops below **70%**, Eremite Galehunter will enter an **Enhanced State**, increasing their resistances by **50%**. They will additionally summon a Bird, which has their own attacks. This also changes the attack patterns of the Galehunter.

This lasts until the Bird is killed, after which the Galehunter will be momentarily stunned, reducing their resists.
