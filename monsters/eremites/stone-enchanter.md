## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

When stunned, Eremite Stone Enchanters get **-60%**​![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)**RES**.

Like other humanoid enemies, you can CC them with​![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-68e4777d7c38eb974be29d8260b1f52709a44a26%2Fanemo\_small.png?alt=media\&token=e3a6e092-2359-45e8-a8cc-20499cfb0eac)skills, making them much easier to deal with.

While enhanced, the Stone Enchanters have increased resistances. Focus on the summoned crocodile first and prioritize killing it before turning back to the Stone Enchanter.

### Enhanced State <a href="#enhanced-state" id="enhanced-state"></a>

When HP drops below **70%**, Eremite Stone Enchanters will enter an **Enhanced State**, increasing their resistances by **50%**. They will additionally summon a Crocodile, which has their own attacks. This also changes the attack patterns of the Stone Enchanter.

This lasts until the Crocodile is killed, after which the Stone Enchanter will be momentarily stunned, reducing their resists.
