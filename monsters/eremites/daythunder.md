## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Core

When stunned, Eremite Daythunders get **-60%**![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)**RES**.

Like other humanoid enemies, you can CC them with![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)skills, making them much easier to deal with.

Their fast attacks and gap closing attack make them particularly deadly. Try to focus them down before they Enhance, or otherwise wait until they're exhausted if you are using melee characters. Shields can also help mitigate their staggering attacks.

### Enhanced State
