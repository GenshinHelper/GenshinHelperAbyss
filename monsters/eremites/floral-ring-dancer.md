## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

When stunned, Eremite Floral Ring-Dancers get **-60%**​![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png)**RES**.

Like other humanoid enemies, you can CC them with​![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MVAGyyACcSzyzfmgy7f%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-68e4777d7c38eb974be29d8260b1f52709a44a26%2Fanemo\_small.png?alt=media\&token=e3a6e092-2359-45e8-a8cc-20499cfb0eac)skills, making them much easier to deal with.

When HP drops below **70%**, Floral Ring-Dancer will enter an **Enhanced State**, increasing their resistances by **50%**. She will additionally summon a Serpent, which has their own attacks. This also changes the attack patterns of the Ring-Dancer.

This lasts until the Serpent is killed, after which the Floral Ring-Dancer will be momentarily stunned, reducing their resists.

### Snipe

Charges up, then fires a fast moving projectile at the player that explodes

The projectile flies very quickly, so you will still be hit if you dodge too early. You will have to time your dodge for just before the projectile lands.

### Teleport Strike
