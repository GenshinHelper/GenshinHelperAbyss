## Resistances

### Normal

|                                        Element | RES      |
| ---------------------------------------------: | -------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **-20%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 10%      |

### **Shielded**

|                                        Element | RES     |
| ---------------------------------------------: | ------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **80%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 110%    |

**\*Note - RES** above 100% does not make them immune to the damage. The damage calculation changes for resists above 75%.

## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

Unless you are able to take him down before he is able to shield, always bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png) against the **Electrohammer**. He is extremely resistant to all damage while shielded. Trying to defeat it while the shield is up will lose a lot of time.

All of the \*\*Electrohammer \*\*attacks can easily be avoided by dodging **behind** him. Avoid attempting to dodge directly in front, as you may get hit by followup attacks.

## Shield

While shielded, the \*\*Electrohammer \*\*gains **+100% RES** to all types of damage, making it extremely resistant.

While shielded, the \*\*Electrohammer's \*\*attacks will be infused with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)is the most effective against the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/hydro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **very ineffective**

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Electrohammer Vanguard shield** has **4U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **2\~4** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element.

## Abilities

### Triple Attack

![Swings hammer in three successive attacks](../../.gitbook/assets/electrohammer\_triple\_attack.gif)

Once started, the\*\* Electrohammer \*\*will continue attacking in the same direction. Dodging **directly behind** during the first swing will avoid the next two swings completely.

### Charge Attack

![Charges at the player and follows up with a slam](../../.gitbook/assets/electrohammer\_charge.gif)

This attack will only be used if the player is far enough away.

### Slam Attack

### Shield

![Creates a shield that increases resistances and infuses attacks](../../.gitbook/assets/electrohammer\_infuse.gif)

Once the shield is broken, the \*\*Electrohammer \*\*will be stunned for about **8 seconds**.
