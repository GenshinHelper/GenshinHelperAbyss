## Resistances

### Normal

|                                        Element | RES      |
| ---------------------------------------------: | -------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **-20%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 10%      |

### **Shielded**

|                                        Element | RES     |
| ---------------------------------------------: | ------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **80%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 110%    |

**\*Note - RES** above 100% does not make them immune to the damage. The damage calculation changes for resists above 75%.

## Tips & Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

Unless you are able to take him down before he is able to shield, always bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png) against the **Cryogunner**. He is extremely resistant to all damage while shielded. Trying to defeat it while the shield is up will lose a lot of time.

The **Jump** ability is easy to avoid by running away from the landing position while the **Cryogunner** is in the air.

The **Spray** attack can do significant damage, particularly once **Shielded**. You can easily run out of it's range to avoid it, or break his **Shield** to interrupt the attack.

## Shield

While shielded, the **Cryogunner Legionnaire** gains **+100% RES** to all types of damage, making it extremely resistant.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)is the most effective against the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **very ineffective**

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Cryogunner Legionnaire shield** has **4U** of strength. This means it takes anywhere between **2\~4** applications of![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)to break the shield, depending on how strong the ability is at applying the element.

## Abilities

### Jump

![Jumps at the player, dealing AoE Cryo damage.](../../.gitbook/assets/cryogunner\_jump.gif)

This attack will only be used if the player is a far enough away.

### Spray

![Sprays a gust of Cryo in an arc](../../.gitbook/assets/cryogunner\_spray.gif)

When **shielded**, the **Spray** attack will be powered up. The **Cryogunner** will walk towards the player, and will turn to face the player.

![Continuous, sweeping Cryo attack](../../.gitbook/assets/cryogunner\_spray\_uninfused.gif)

The powered up attack will also last much longer than the standard - about **12 seconds** total.

### Shield

![Creates a shield that absorbs damage.](../../.gitbook/assets/cryogunner\_shield.gif)

Once the shield is broken, the **Cryogunner **will be stunned for about **8 seconds**.
