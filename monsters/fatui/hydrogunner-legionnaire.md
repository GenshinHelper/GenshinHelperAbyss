## Resistances

### Normal

|                                        Element | RES      |
| ---------------------------------------------: | -------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **-20%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 10%      |

### **Shielded**

|                                        Element | RES     |
| ---------------------------------------------: | ------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **80%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 110%    |

**\*Note - RES** above 100% does not make them immune to the damage. The damage calculation changes for resists above 75%.

## Tips & Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

Unless you are able to take him down before he is able to shield, always bring![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png) against the **Hydrogunner**. He is extremely resistant to all damage while shielded. Trying to defeat it while the shield is up will lose a lot of time.

Since he can heal allies, you should prioritize the **Hydrogunner** if he is present. The **Shield **is also particularly tough to get down compared to other Fatui. Bursting him down before he is able to shield can save a lot of time.

## Shield

While shielded, the **Hydrogunner Legionnaire** gains **+100% RES** to all types of damage, making it extremely resistant.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)is the most effective against the shield.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cryo\_small.png)is ineffective at breaking the shield, but can **Freeze** the **Hydrogunner.**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/geo\_small.png)will also damage the shield, but are **very ineffective**

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Hydrogunner Legionnaire shield** has **4U** of strength. This means it takes about **5 ticks** of **Electrocharged** via![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)to break the shield.
{% endhint %}
