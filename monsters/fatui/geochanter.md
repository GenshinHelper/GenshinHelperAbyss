## Resistances

### Normal

|                                        Element | RES      |
| ---------------------------------------------: | -------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **-20%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 10%      |

### **Shielded**

|                                        Element | RES     |
| ---------------------------------------------: | ------- |
| ![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png) | **80%** |
|                             ALL OTHER ELEMENTS | 110%    |

**\*Note - RES** above 100% does not make them immune to the damage. The damage calculation changes for resists above 75%.

### Tips & Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Face

Geochanters are not dangerous, and can be left alone provided you have a way to get through their shields.

Like other Gunner types, they can be picked up by![](../../.gitbook/assets/anemo\_small.png)abilities and disabled.

## Shield

While shielded, the Geochanter gains **+100% RES** to all types of damage, making it extremely resistant.

### Shield

Creates a shield that increases resistances

Once the shield is broken, the Geochanter will be stunned for about **8 seconds**.

### Barrier (Shielded)

Creates AoE barrier that will block incoming projectiles.

Moving inside the AoE makes this attack useless. It also makes it easier to group enemies together as the Geochanter stops moving away from you.
