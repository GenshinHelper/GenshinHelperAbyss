## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Face

The activated Cryoshroom will perform dive attacks faster and more often. Avoid doing this.

### Activated/Scorched

Mushrooms change states when they first come into contact with![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)or![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png).

![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)will cause them to **activate**, **increasing** their movement and attack speeds.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)will cause them to **scorch**, **decreasing** their movement and attack speeds.

Avoid using![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)based attacks first if possible. If you do, consider bringing a![](../../.gitbook/assets/pyro\_small.png)and hitting them with those skills first to get them **scorched**, after which it is safe to use![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png).

### Flying

The Cryoshroom will occasionally go airborne. If you do enough damage with ranged attacks, it will knock it to the ground, briefly stunning it.
