## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

Components summoned by each construct are similar to the abilities used by the main machine. Focus on those when summoned as they air fairly weak, and then hit them with an![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)attack to stun the construct.

Unlike other Ruin type enemies, these do not have extra![](../../.gitbook/assets/physical\_small.png)RES. All attacks are equally effective.

### Invisibility

Primal constructs will periodically go invisible, gaining **+50% ALL RES**, and sending out components that will attack you.&#x20;

There are two ways to end invisibility:

* Damage the **Primal Construct Parts** that are sent out to attack you. They cannot be destroyed, but when they run out of HP they will enter **recovery**. Using an![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)attack during this time will paralyze ASIMON and break invisibility.

* Hit the invisible Primcal Construct directly with a **Quicken** reaction (![](../../.gitbook/assets/electro\_small.png)+![](../../.gitbook/assets/dendro\_small.png))
