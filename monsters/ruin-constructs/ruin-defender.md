## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Eye Core

The **core** is only exposed during the **Cannon** attack. Watch out for it and stun the **Ruin Defender** while it charges that attack.

The **Ruin Defender** is not particularly threatening, but the **Shield** can make it annoying to kill. It's best to focus other enemies during it's **Shield** ability and let it come to you after it's done.

## Abilities

### Shield

Activates a shield, protecting from attacks on the front.
{% endembed %}

This works similarly to other **physical shields** (see [Shields](../../mechanics/shields.md)). Simply attack it from behind, or use **Freeze** to bypass the shield entirely.

The **Ruin Defender** turns slower than other enemies with physical shields, making it possible to continually run behind it for attacks.

During this ability, the **Ruin Defender** will not move.

This ability lasts about **15 seconds**.

### Shield Smash

Thrusts the shield forward at the player.
{% endembed %}

This attack is only used when **Shield** is active, and only if you enter \*\*melee \*\*range. There's about a **10 second** cooldown before this ability can be used again.

### Stab

A forward thrusting attack.
{% endembed %}

### Leap

Jumps into the air and lands, dealing damage in an AoE.
{% endembed %}

### Cannon

{% embed url="https://gfycat.com/exhaustedsomeaustraliancattledog" %}
Charges up, then releases an energy blast at the player.
{% endembed %}

The **core** is **exposed** while this attack is charging. Hit the weak point during to stun it.
