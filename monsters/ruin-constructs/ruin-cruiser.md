## Tips and Mechanics

**Weak Point** - Eye Core

The **core** is not exposed often, so watch for the attacks that leave it vulnerable.

**Ruin Cruisers** use ranged attacks. Focus on them first and let other enemies come to you in order to group enemies together.

## Abilities

### Orb Dash

### Tri-Shot

The **core** is **exposed** while this attack is charging. Hit the weak point during to stun it.

While **charged bow** attacks are easiest, any skill that can reach the **core** can be used to stun.

### Bombardment

Charges up, then unleashes multiple waves of energy on an AoE.
{% endembed %}

The **core** is **exposed** while this attack is charging. Hit the weak point during to stun it.

Once the **bombardment** starts, the **core** cannot be hit anymore. Make sure you hit it during the charge.
