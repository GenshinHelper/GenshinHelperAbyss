## Tips and Mechanics <a href="#tips-and-mechanics" id="tips-and-mechanics"></a>

**Weak Point** - Core (Eye)

The weak point is only exposed after it absorbs the element and in a small window before using the **Barrage** attack. Unless you can kill it before it does this attack, it is important to bring a character that can hit the Eye and interrupt it during this time.

If your team primarily does damage of a single element, it is very important to interrupt the Barrage attack. If your team has mixed damage, you may be able to ignore it.

### Elemental Absorption

After some time, the Ruin Drake will infuse based on whichever element it has taken the most damage from so far. While infused, it will gain **+40% RES** to that element, as well as performing it's **Barrage** attack infused with the same element.

During this time, the Eye (core) will be exposed. Hitting the eye with certain attacks (e.g. charged attack with a bow with interrupt the attack, as well as removing the Resistance bonus.

Hitting the eye with certain attacks (e.g. charged attacks with a bow) will stun it, interrupting the attack and removing the Resistance bonus.
