## Current Blessing

**Duration:** Dec 1st - 15th

When characters trigger Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon on an opponent, all party members will gain 10% Dendro DMG Bonus for 10s. This bonus can be triggered once every 5s. Max 4 stacks. Once 4 stacks have been gained, when characters deal Dendro DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed in this way once every 5s.
