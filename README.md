## Current Blessing

**Duration:** Jan 16th - 31st

When the active character deals consecutive instances of Elemental DMG of the same Elemental Type using Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts to an opponent, they will gain 1 count stack. 1 stack can be gained every 1s.

After 5 stacks have been gained, a shockwave will be unleashed at the opponent's position, dealing True DMG and clearing all heretofore accumulated stacks. Should the active character leave the field or deal a different type of Elemental DMG, these stacks will also be cleared. Dealing Physical DMG will not clear the stacks.
