## Current Blessing

When characters deal DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. Each Elemental DMG Type (including Physical DMG) can unleash a shockwave this way every 8s

This blessing rewards you for both using compositions with as many different elements as possible, as well as rotating frequently between characters. Try to build towards this if your teams normally lack damage.
