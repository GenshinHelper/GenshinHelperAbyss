## Current Blessing

**Duration:** April 1st - 15th

After a character's **Normal Attack** hits an opponent, this opponent will be afflicted with a **Mark of Ending**.&#x20;

After 10s, this Mark of Ending will be removed, dealing **True DMG** to this opponent.

When a character's **Normal Attack** hits an opponent with a **Mark of Ending**, the DMG dealt by the Mark of Ending's removal will be increased. This DMG can be increased 9 times.
