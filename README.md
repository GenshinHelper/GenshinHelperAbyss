## Current Blessing

**Duration:** December 1st - 15th

Shards from **Crystallize** reactions give you 1 stack of **Extract**. Each stack gives active character **8% DMG for 10s** (max 3 stacks).

When characters possessing 3 stacks obtain more **Crystallize** reaction-created shards, they will unleash a shockwave that deals **True DMG** to opponents (max once every 3 seconds)

### Notes

* Shockwaves damage scales with the floor
