## Current Blessing

**Duration:** Feb 16th - 28th

After a character deals Dendro DMG to opponents through Normal Attack, Charged Attack, Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, or Elemental Burst, the character will gain one stack of Verdant Vigor: DMG dealt by the character will be increased by 8% for 6s.

This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Max 6 stacks. Each stack's duration is counted independently.
