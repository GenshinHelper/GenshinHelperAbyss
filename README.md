## Current Blessing

**Duration:** Jan 1st - 15th

When a character deals **Elemental DMG** to opponents with a **Normal ATK, Charged ATK, Plunging ATK, Elemental Skill, or Elemental Burst,** all party members gain **10% Bonus DMG for that element**, and will gain **10% more Bonus DMG every 3s** (max 100% bonus).

When a character deals a different type of **Elemental DMG** to an opponent this way, the previous Elemental DMG Bonus gained will **reset**.
