## Current Blessing

**Duration:** November 16th - 30th

When a character's **Elemental Energy** is **>= 50%**, they will continuously release shockwaves that deal **DMG** to opponents

When their **Elemental Energy reaches 100%**, these shockwaves will deal even **greater DMG**.

### Notes

* Shockwaves are **PHYS DMG** and their damage scales with the floor
