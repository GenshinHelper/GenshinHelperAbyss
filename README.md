## Current Blessing

**Duration:** November 1st - 15th

When a character's **Elemental Energy is 100%**, they will gain 1 stack of **Auspice **every second. Max 10 stacks.

When this character unleashes their **Elemental Burst**, all **Auspice **stacks will be cleared, and the **DMG **dealt by this character will be increased by **5%/stack** for **10s**. They cannot gain any more stacks during this time.
