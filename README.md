## Current Blessing

**Duration:** October 1st - 15th

For **10s** after a character uses an **Elemental Burst**, that character's **Normal and Charged Attacks** will unleash a **shockwave** at the position of the opponent they hit at the cost of **1% of the character's HP**, dealing **AoE DMG** \(max one per second\). This effect will be cleared when this character leaves the field. 

Active characters can go down as a result of this HP loss.

### Characters Buffed by Blessing

Any character can benefit from this blessing.
