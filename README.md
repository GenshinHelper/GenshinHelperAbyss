## Current Blessing

**Duration:** April 1st - 15th

After a character's **Normal Attack** deals DMG to an opponent, the **Physical/Elemental RES** of this opponent will decrease by **6% for 5s**, matching the **type of DMG** dealt.

This can stack up to 7 times. RES decreases of different types can co-exist, and their stacks and timers will be independent of each other.
